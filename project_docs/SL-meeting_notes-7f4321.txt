**Meeting Objective:** Review current status of the Unnamed Gulf Telco Self-Care Portal, address outstanding technical defects, and discuss path forward.

---

**Discussion Points & Action Items:**

*   **Opening & Introductions (10:00 AM)**
    *   Sarah Chen opened the meeting, welcomed attendees.
    *   David Lee was already on the call, Maria Garcia joined at 10:05 AM.
    *   Omar Hassan joined at 10:07 AM.
    *   Mr. Al-Mansoori joined at 10:15 AM. Alex Kim joined at 10:20 AM.

*   **Project Overview & Current State (Sarah Chen)**
    *   Portal launched successfully, initial support call reduction noted.
    *   Post-launch stability issues were reported, mostly remedied in patch releases.
    *   Still seeing some intermittent errors, particularly around… uh… the payment gateway integration? David, can you confirm the exact module?
    *   David Lee: Yeah, it's the transaction processing module. We think it's related to the asynchronous calls to the billing backend. The logs are… messy.

al Defect Review (Maria Garcia & David Lee)**
    *   **Defect #1: User Profile Update Failure (Severity: High)**
        *   Maria Garcia: Users are reporting that when they try to update their profile information, it sometimes fails with a generic error message. We've seen this in QA, but it's intermittent.
        *   David Lee: I don't think that's right, Maria. The logs show a 500 error on the API gateway, not our backend. It's probably an infrastructure issue.
        *   Maria Garcia: But the error message is coming from our front-end code, David. We're catching the exception.
        *   David Lee: Well, the exception handling might be too broad. We need to look at the actual API response.
        *   Omar Hassan: The user impact is significant. They can't update their contact details.
        *   **ACTION:** David Lee to investigate API gateway logs for Defect #1.
        *   **ACTION:** Maria Garcia to provide specific user scenarios where Defect #1 is occurring.
        *   **FOLLOW UP:** What's the root cause of the 500 error? (No owner, no deadline)

    *   **Defect #2: Billing Statement Discrepancies (Severity: Medium)**
        *   Omar Hassan: We've had a few reports of users seeing incorrect amounts on their billing statements within the portal. This is concerning.
        *   David Le
[Attendee left early for another meeting]
e: That's definitely a backend issue. The data is coming directly from the billing system. We're just displaying it.
        *   Maria Garcia: But the data transformation logic is on our side, David. We're mapping the billing system's data to our portal's format. There could be an error there.
        *   David Lee: The mapping logic is standard. It's been tested. This sounds like a data integrity problem in the billing system itself.
        *   Mr. Al-Mansoori: [CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL] This is a critical issue. Our customers expect accurate billing information.
        *   Sarah Chen: Okay, let's not point fingers. We need to get to the bottom of this.
        *   **ACTION:** David Lee to review data transformation logic for Defect #2.
        *   **ACTION:** Omar Hassan to gather specific examples of billing statement discrepancies.
        *   **FOLLOW UP:** Is the billing system API documented properly? (No owner, no deadline)

    *   **Defect #3: Session Timeout Issues (Severity: Low)**
        *   Maria Garcia: Users are getting logged out unexpectedly after shorter periods than the configured session timeout.
        *   David Lee: That's a known issue. We're using a third-party session management library, and there's a known bug in their latest release. We're waiting for a patch from them.
        *   Alex Kim: (Joining late) Yeah, I saw that. The workaround involves… something with cookies. I need to check the documentation for that library. It's not well-maintained.
        *   Sarah Chen: So, we're dependent on a third party for this?
        *   David Lee: For now, yes. We could refactor to our own session management, but that's a significant chunk of technical debt we've been

carrying.
        *   Omar Hassan: How long have we been waiting for this patch?
        *   David Lee: A few weeks. They said it's a priority.
        *   **ACTION:** Alex Kim to investigate workaround for Defect #3.
        *   **ACTION:** David Lee to check with the third-party vendor for an update on the patch.

*   **Budget & Resource Concerns (Sarah Chen)**
    *   Sarah Chen: We're approaching the allocated budget for post-launch support. These ongoing defects are impacting our ability to… uh… move on to the next phase.
    *   Mr. Al-Mansoori: [CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL] We need these issues resolved before we can consider any further enhancements. The initial investment was significant, and we expect a stable platform.
    *   Omar Hassan: We've been burning through our contingency.

*   **Off-Topic Discussion (11:00 AM)**
    *   David Lee: Speaking of technical debt, the old authentication module is a nightmare. If we ever need to…
    *   Sarah Chen: David, let's stay focused on the current defects.
    *   Maria Garcia: But if we don't address the underlying architecture, we'll keep seeing these problems. Remember that incident with the…
    *   Sarah Chen: Maria, please.

*   **Decisions & Path Forward**
    *   Sarah Chen: Okay, so for Defect #1, we'll prioritize David's investigation. For Defect #2, we need to confirm if it's our code or the billing system.
    *   David Lee: I still think it's the billing system.
    *   Maria Garcia: And I still think it's our transformation logic.
    *   Sarah Chen: We'll get to the bottom of it. For Defect #3, Alex will look into the workaround.
    *   **DECISI
[Audio cut out - missed 2 minutes]
ON (Tentative):** We will proceed with the third-party vendor's patch for Defect #3, assuming it's released soon. If not, we'll re-evaluate.
    *   Omar Hassan: What if the patch doesn't fix it?
    *   David Lee: Then we'll have to look at the workaround or refactor.

*   **Next Steps (No Owners/Deadlines)**
    *   Follow up on Defect #1 logs.
    *   Gather more user examples for Defect #2.
    *   Check third-party vendor status.
    *   Investigate session timeout workaround.
    *   Review documentation for the session management library.
    *   Discuss budget implications further in the next meeting.

*   **Meeting Wrap-up (11:30 AM)**
    *   Sarah Chen thanked everyone for their time.
    *   Mr. Al-Mansoori expressed his concern about the pace of resolution.
    *   The next meeting will be scheduled for… sometime next week.

**Notes:**

*   Several action items are vague and lack clear ownership or deadlines.
*   Contradictory statements regarding the root cause of defects were prevalent.
*   Technical debt was acknowledged but no concrete plan to address it was formed.
*   Missing documentation was referenced multiple times.
*   The budget situation is a growing concern, but not being actively managed.
*   Decisions made were often qualified with "tentative" or "re-evaluate."
*   The meeting was significantly delayed by late arrivals and off-topic discussions.
