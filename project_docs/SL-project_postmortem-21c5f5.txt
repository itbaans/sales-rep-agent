## Project Post-Mortem: Unnamed Gulf Telco Self-Care Portal (SL-5251-2023)

**Date:** 2024-01-15

**Prepared By:** Project Management Office (PMO)

**Project Code:** SL-5251-2023

**Client:** Unnamed Gulf Telco

**Location:** Middle East

**Year:** 2023

---

### **Executive Summary (Abridged)**

The Unnamed Gulf Telco Self-Care Portal project, aimed at enhancing customer experience and reducing operational overhead, was successfully launched in Q4 2023. The portal provides mobile and web access to key self-service functionalities, including billing inquiries and plan management, integrated with the client's existing Oracle billing system. Initial post-launch stability issues were addressed through subsequent patch releases. While the project achieved its primary objective of reducing support calls, there were notable challenges encountered during development and deployment, primarily related to technical defects and integration complexities.

### **Project Goals & Objectives (Revisited)**

*   **Primary Goal:** Launch a functional mobile and web self-care portal for Unnamed Gulf Telco customers.
*   **Secondary Goal:** Reduce inbound customer support calls by X% (Actual: TBD).
*   **Tertiary Goal:** Improve customer satisfaction scores (Actual: TBD).
*   **Technical Objective:** Seamless integration with the Oracle billing system.

---

### **Project Timeline & Milestones (High-Level)**

*   **Initiation:** Q1 2023
*   **Development Phase:** Q2-Q3 2023
*   **Testing & UAT:** Q3-Q4 2023
*   **Go-Live:** November 2023
*   **Post-Launch Support:** Ongoing

### **What Went Right (The Upside)**

*   **Successful Launch:** The portal is live and accessible to Unnamed Gulf Telco customers.
*   **Reduced Support Calls (Anecdotal):** Anecdotal evidence from the client suggests a positive impact on support call volume. *[Note: Formal metrics are pending client confirmation.]*
*   **Positive Client Feedback (Initial):** The client expressed satisfaction with the overall functionality and user interface upon initial demonstration.
*   **Team Dedication:** The project team demonstrated significant commitment and worked diligently to meet deadlines.
*   **Tech Stack Proficiency:** The chosen tech stack (Angular, Java/Spring, REST APIs) proved robust for the core functionalities.

### **What Went Wrong (The Reality Check)**

#### **Technical Defects & Stability Issues (The Core Problem)**

*   **Conflicting Accounts:**
    *   **Development Team Lead (Dev Lead):** "The issues were primarily due to unforeseen complexities in the Oracle billing system's API layer. We encountered data inconsistencies that were not present in the sandbox environment. The integration testing was thorough, but the production environment presented unique challenges."
    *   **QA Lead:** "We identified a significant number of critical and major defects during UAT. The development team's response time to fix these was often delayed, impacting our ability to achieve sign-off within the planned window. Some de

fects were also deemed 'out of scope' by development, which we disagreed with."
    *   **Infrastructure Lead:** "The initial deployment experienced performance bottlenecks. We suspect the backend services were not adequately optimized for the anticipated load, despite our capacity planning exercises. The database queries related to billing data were particularly slow."
    *   **Client Representative:** "The portal was unstable immediately after launch. Customers reported frequent errors and slow loading times. This was a significant concern and impacted our brand reputation."

*   **Blame-Shifting:**
    *   **Dev Lead to QA:** "The QA team's test cases were not comprehensive enough to cover all edge cases, especially concerning the intricate billing logic. They also missed several critical data validation issues that were only discovered in production."
    *   **QA Lead to Dev:** "The development team introduced regressions with almost every new build. Their unit testing was insufficient, leading to a cascade of defects that we had to catch. The 'fixes' were often quick patches that introduced new problems."
    *   **Dev Lead to Client (Oracle Integration):** "The Oracle billing system's documentation was outdated and incomplete. We had to reverse-engineer a significant portion of the integration, which was a major time sink and source of errors. The client's internal Oracle team was not as responsive as we had hoped."
    *   **Infrastructure Lead to Dev:** "The application code was not optimized for performance. We provided recommendations for code refactoring, but these were not fully implemented due to time constraints."

#### **Integration Challenges (The Oracle Conundrum)**

*   **Incomplete Metrics:**
    *   Number of integration-related defects: **[Missing Data]**
    *   Average time to resolve integration defects: **[Missing Data]**
    *   Number of API calls to Oracle billing system: **[Missing Data]**
    *   Success rate of Oracle API calls: **[Missing Data]**

*   **Conflicting Assessments:**
    *   **Dev Lead:** "The integration was a Herculean effort. We built robust error handling, but the Oracle system's responses were unpredictable."
    *   **Client Representative:** "The integration with our billing system was supposed to be a core strength. We expected a seamless experience, not constant errors and data discrepancies."

#### **Scope Creep & Requirements Volatility (The Moving Target)**

*   **TBD Items:**
    *   Additional payment gateway integration: **TBD** (Deferred to Phase 2)
    *   Advanced reporting module: **TBD** (Deferred to Phase 2)
    *   Personalized plan recommendations: **TBD** (Deferred to Phase 2)
    *   Real-time data synchronization with billing: **TBD** (Ongoing challenge)

*   **Corporate Jargon:** "We experienced some 'scope recalibration' during the project lifecycle, necessitating 'agile adjustments' to the original roadmap. This was managed through our established 'change control framework'." (Translation: The client kept asking for more things, and we struggled to keep up.)

### **Budget & Resource Management (The Financial Strain)**

*   **Budget Overruns:** The project exceeded its allocated budget by **[Missing Data]%**.
*   **Vague Justifications:**
    *   "Increased effort required for unforeseen technical complexities."
    *   "Extended testing cycles due to defect resolution."
    *   "Additional resources allocated to address critical post-launch issues."
    *   "Unforeseen vendor dependencies."

*   **Resource Allocation:**
    *   Development Team: **[Missing Data]** FTEs
    *   QA Team: **[Missing Data]** FTEs
    *   Project Management: **[Missing Data]** FTEs
    *   Infrastructure: **[Missing Data]** FTEs

### **Lessons Learned (The Optimistic Spin vs. Harsh Reality)**

*   **Optimistic Spin:**
    *   "Agile methodologies allowed for flexibility and adaptation."
    *   "Cross-functional collaboration was key to overcoming challenges."
    *   "Continuous improvement is embedded in our development process."
    *   "The team's resilience in the face of adversity is commendable."

*   **Harsh Reality:**
    *   "Inadequate upfront analysis of the Oracle billing system's complexities led to significant rework."
    *   "Insufficient unit testing and code reviews by the development team resulted in a high defect density."
    *   "The QA team was overwhelmed by the volume and severity of defects, leading to rushed testing cycles."
    *   "Communication breakdowns between development, QA, and infrastructure teams exacerbated issues."
    *   "The client's lack of timely engagement on crit

ical integration points caused delays."
    *   "Our risk management process failed to adequately identify and mitigate the integration risks."
