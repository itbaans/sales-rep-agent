Subject: URGENT: Critical Issues with Islamic Bank API Platform - Project SL-6244-None

Dear TechSolutions Delivery Team,

I am writing to report critical issues we are experiencing with the recently implemented API Platform for Project SL-6244-None. Since the go-live, we have observed significant performance degradation and intermittent failures, particularly impacting our new mobile onboarding feature.

Specifically, users are reporting extremely high latency when accessing core banking functionalities through the API. We have also encountered several instances where API calls are timing out, leading to failed transactions and a severely degraded user experience.

Our internal analysis suggests these issues may be related to the integration with our legacy core banking system. We require immediate attention and a clear plan of action to address these critical performance bottlenecks. Please provide an update on your investigation and proposed solutions within 24 hours.

Regards,

Aisha Khan
Senior Manager, Digital Banking

Dear Aisha,

Thank you for your prompt feedback. We acknowledge the reported issues and are actively investigating.

Our initial assessment indicates that the observed latency might be attributed to the inherent constraints of the legacy system, as previously discussed during the project's discovery phase. We are currently performing load testing and analyzing network traffic to pinpoint the exact root cause.

We will provide a more detailed update by end of day tomorrow, October 27th, with a proposed remediation strategy.

Best regards,

The TechSolutions Delivery Team

Team,

I've been copied on this thread and need to escalate the urgency. The issues Aisha has highlighted are impacting our customer acquisition and retention. We cannot afford to have a degraded user experience, especially with the new mobile onboarding initiative.

TechSolutions, your initial response is noted, but "inherent constraints of the legacy system" is not a satisfactory explanation at this stage. We need concrete actions and a clear timeline for resolution.

Aisha, please ensure you are providing all relevant logs and performance metrics to the TechSolutions team.

This is unacceptable. The lead engineer is out of office, and we are still without a concrete plan. The issues are worsening.

Furthermore, I am forwarding an email from our internal QA team that raises concerns about the API Gateway configuration. They believe some of the latency might be due to suboptimal caching strategies implemented by TechSolutions.

**Subject:** API Platform Performance - Potential Caching Issues

Aisha,

I've been reviewing the API platform's performance metrics and have noticed that the caching layer seems to be misconfigured. Specifically, certain frequently accessed data is not being cached effectively, leading to repeated calls to the backend. This could be a significant contributor to the observed latency. I've attached a detailed analysis of the caching configuration and suggested improvements.

TechSolutions, please address the caching concerns raised by our QA team. We need a unified technical assessment and a clear path forward.

Dear Aisha,

Thank you for forwarding the QA analysis. We have reviewed the document.

While we appreciate the insights from your QA team, our architecture team has a different perspective. The current caching strategy was implemented based on the initial requirements and our understanding of the legacy system's data volatility. Introducing aggressive caching without a thorough understanding of the data dependencies could lead to data inconsistency issues, which would be far more detrimental.

Our primary focus remains on optimizing the interaction with the core banking system. We are currently working on a solution to streamline the data retrieval process from the legacy backend. This involves a series of micro-optimizations within the API layer that will directly address t

he latency.

We will be deploying a patch by end of day Monday, October 30th, which we believe will significantly improve performance. We will also be scheduling a joint technical deep-dive session early next week to align on the architectural approach.

**Please note:** The attachment mentioned in the forwarded message was not received. Kindly resend the "API_Caching_Analysis_v1.pdf".

This is becoming a significant concern for the bank. The lack of a clear, unified technical approach and the conflicting assessments are unacceptable.

TechSolutions, your "micro-optimizations" and vague commitments are not instilling confidence. We need a robust solution, not a series of band-aids. The fact that the attachment was not received is also a sign of poor communication.

Aisha, please ensure all necessary documentation is shared and that we have a clear understanding of the proposed solution and its impact on data integrity.

We expect a comprehensive update by EOD today, outlining the specific changes being made and the expected performance improvements.

Dear all,

Following our deployment of the performance patch earlier today, we have observed a marginal improvement in API response times. However, the issues are not entirely resolved, and we are still seeing intermittent timeouts.

Our investigation has revealed that the legacy system's database connection pooling is a significant bottleneck. This is an inherent limitation of the core banking system itself, which was not fully disclosed during the initial requirements gathering. We are now working on a workaround that involves optimizing the connection management within the API platform to mitigate the impact of this bottleneck.

We understand your frustration. We are committed to finding a resolution. We will be providing a revised action plan by tomorrow morning, outlining the steps for this workaround.

**Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Please disregard any previous internal discussions regarding the specific database connection pool sizes. This information is confidential and should not be shared externally.

Best regards,

This is beyond disappointing. "Marginal improvement" is not what we signed up for. And now you're shifting blame to "inherent limitations of the core banking system" that were "not fully disclosed"? This is a serious accusation.

The "sensitive information disclosure" is also highly unprofessional.

We are still experiencing significant latency, and the mobile onboarding feature remains unreliable. The proposed "workaround" sounds like another attempt to mask the underlying architectural flaws.

We need a definitive solution, not more excuses. We will be reviewing our contract and considering further action if these issues are not addressed immediately and effectively.
