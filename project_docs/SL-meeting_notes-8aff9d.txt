**Discussion Points & Notes:**

*   **Project Overview & Current Status:**
    *   Sarah opened, apologizing for lateness, mentioned a "minor fire" in another project.
    *   David provided a brief update on the integration layer development. Said it's "mostly there" but some endpoints are still… fuzzy.
    *   Maria mentioned the requirements ambiguity is still the main blocker. We're still getting conflicting info on how inventory levels should be handled, especially with… you know, the returns process.
    *   Ben chimed in about the ERP side. Said the APIs are documented, but the actual implementation on their end seems to be… a bit of a moving target. He referenced some internal documentation that nobody else seems 
[ACTION ITEM: Unclear owner - never followed up]
to have access to.
    *   Emily stated QA is blocked due to the requirement ambiguity. Can't write test cases without clear definitions.

*   **Key Issue: Requirements Ambiguity:**
    *   Maria reiterated the core problem: "What *exactly* do we need to sync for inventory? Is it just on-hand, or do we need to account for WIP, or…?"
    *   John (finally joining) asked if we'd even finalized the chart of accounts mapping. Said finance needs that before anything else can really…
    *   David interjected, "But the finance mapping depends on how the ERP *actually* posts transactions. We can't just assume. The initial spec was… different."
    *   Sarah tried to steer back: "Okay, so the inventory sync is the immediate problem. Maria, what's the latest on the… the workshop we were supposed to have?"
    *   Maria: "We tried to schedule it, but John's team was unavailable, and Alex is still out. And Ben said his availability was limited because of the… the other thing."
    *   Ben: "Yeah, the internal PoC for the new module is taking up a lot of my bandwidth. This ERP integration feels like it's built on… older tech anyway. We
[ACTION ITEM: Unclear owner - never followed up]
're seeing a lot of technical debt creeping in."
    *   Sarah: "We acknowledged the technical debt, Ben. We need to focus on the immediate deliverables. What about the phase cancellation midway? Was that related to this?"
    *   David: "Partially. The original scope was too broad, and the requirements were never solid enough to even start that phase properly. We spent weeks trying to get clarity on the supply chain side, and Alex was… not responsive."
    *   Maria: "I think the issue is that the business processes themselves aren't fully defined for the *new* ERP. We're trying to integrate with something that's still evolving internally."

*   **Budget Concerns:**
    *   Sarah: "Just a reminder, we're… approaching the allocated budget for this phase. We need to be efficient with our time."
    *   John: "Efficient? We're still waiting on the finalized GL integration points. How can we be efficient if we don't know what we're integrating *with*?"
    *   David: "And the development effort for the inventory sync is significantly higher than initially estimated because of the… the complexity we uncovered. The original estimates were based on… different assumptions."

*   **Technical Details & Contradictions:**
    *   David mentioned the data transformation layer is using a custom Python script, but Ben insisted the ERP documentation specifies a standard XML schema for all integrations.
    *   Ben: "The ERP's data model for inventory is pretty straightforward. It's just a matter of mapping the fields correctly. The documentation is clear on this."
    *   Maria: "But the ERP specialist we spoke to last month said the inventory module has been heavily customized, and the standard schema doesn't account for our specific batch tra

cking requirements."
    *   Sarah: "Okay, so we have conflicting information on the ERP's data structure. FOLLOW UP: David, can you share the latest version of your integration mapping document? And Ben, can you provide the specific ERP documentation you're referencing?"

*   **Decisions & Walkbacks:**
    *   Earlier in the week, it was decided to prioritize the finance module integration.
    *   John: "I still think finance is the critical path. If we don't get the GL posting right, nothing else matters."
    *   David: "But the inventory sync is directly impacting our ability to even *test* the finance module. We can't post transactions if we don't have accurate inventory values to begin with."
    *   Sarah: "Okay, so we're back to inventory being the immediate blocker. We'll pivot back to that. FOLLOW UP: Maria, can you schedule a dedicated session with John and David to nail down the inventory sync requirements?"

*   **Off-Topic Discussions:**
    *   Ben spent a good 10 minutes explaining the benefits of the new internal PoC

module and how it will revolutionize their manufacturing processes, which is… great, but not directly relevant to SL-4855.
    *   John started discussing a recent audit finding related to data integrity, which, while important, was a tangent.

*   **[CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL] Discussion:**
    *   Sarah: "Regarding the [CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL] data synchronization, we're still facing significant challenges with the data cleansing process. The initial data quality assessment was… optimistic."
    *   Maria: "The [CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL] fields are particularly problematic. We're seeing a lot of missing values and inconsistent formatting. It's impacting the accuracy of the financial reporting."
    *   David: "We've built some data validation rules, but they're not catching everything. It's a lot of manual effort to correct."

*   **N
