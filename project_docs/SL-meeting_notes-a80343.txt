**Meeting Minutes:**

*   **Opening & Introductions (Sarah Chen)**
    *   Sarah apologized for the late start, citing a prior urgent call.
    *   Briefly reiterated the purpose of the meeting: to get a handle on the current state and address blockers.
    *   Mr. Tariq joined, apologized for his lateness due to a prior client meeting.

*   **Project Status Update (David Lee)**
    *   David started by saying things are "progressing, but with significant headwinds."
    *   Mentioned the core API gateway is deployed, but integration with the legacy backend is… problematic.
    *   "We're seeing some latency spikes, especially during peak hours. Not sure if it's the gateway config or the actual backend response times."
    *   **[CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL]** David alluded to some internal discussions about the proposed caching strategy, but didn't elaborate.
    *   Maria chimed in, "The documentation for the legacy system is… sparse. We're essentially reverse-engineering some of the endpoints."
    *   Omar added, "Yeah, and 
[Important decision made without key stakeholder]
the data formats are inconsistent. Sometimes it's JSON, sometimes it's… something else. We're building custom parsers on the fly."

*   **Key Issues Discussion:**

    *   **Legacy System Constraints (All)**
        *   Sarah: "So, the main concern is the legacy system. What are the concrete limitations we're facing?"
        *   David: "The main issue is the synchronous nature of a lot of the core banking functions. Our platform is designed for asynchronous operations, and forcing s
[ACTION ITEM: Unclear owner - never followed up]
ynchronous calls through the gateway is… not ideal."
        *   Maria: "And the throughput. The legacy system can only handle X requests per second, and we're already hitting that with just our initial test cases. The mobile onboarding feature alone will… well, it's going to be a bottleneck."
        *   Omar: "I'm still not convinced the current architecture can handle the load. The proposed microservices architecture seems to be fighting against the monolithic backend."
        *   Ben: "From a QA perspective, we're struggling to get reliable performance metrics because the legacy system itself is so unpredictable. We're seeing test failures that aren't reproducible."
        *   Mr. Tariq: "But the agreement was that the platform would modernize the backend. Are you saying the legacy system cannot support the modernization?"
        *   David: "It's not that it *cannot*, Mr. Tariq, it's that the *way* it needs to be interacted with is fundamentally at odds with a modern API-first approach. We're trying to put a sports car engine in a horse-drawn carriage."
        *   Sarah: "Let's try to keep it constructive. What are the *specific* technical constraints we need to document for the client?"
        *   Maria: "The lack of proper error handling in the legacy system is a major issue. We're getting generic error codes that don't tell us anything."
        *   Omar: "And the database connections. They're not optimized for high concurrency. We're seeing connection pool exhaustion."
        *   **FOLLOW UP:** What is the exact throughput limit of the core banking system? (No owner assigned)

    *   **Requirements Ambiguity (Aisha Khan, David Lee)**
        *   Aisha: "Regarding the requirements for the third-party app integrations, there are still several areas that are not clearly defined. For example, the exact data fields for the 'customer profile' endpoint."
        *   David: "Yes, Aisha, we've raised this multiple times. The initial scope document was… light on detail. We've had to make assumptions, and some of those assumptions are now proving to be incorrect."
        *   Maria: "The requirements for the 'transaction history' endpoint are also a mess. The client wants to filter by date range, but the legacy system only returns data in fixed chunks."
        *   Aisha: "But we discussed the pagination strategy for that. It was agreed that…"
        *   David: "Agreed, but the implementation of that pagination on the legacy side is proving to be incredibly slow. It's almost as slow as fetching all the data and then filtering it ourselves."
        *   Mr. Tariq: "The requirements were provided by our business teams. Are you saying our business teams are providing unclear requirements?"
        *   Sarah: "Mr. Tariq, we're trying to identify areas where we can improve clarity and ensure successful implementation. It's a collaborative effort."
        *   Aisha: "The requirements for the 'account balance' endpoint also need clarification. The client wants real-time balance, but the legacy system updates the balance with a delay."
        *   David: "Which brings us back to the latency and the legacy system constraints. We can't provide 'real-time' if the source system isn't real-time."
        *   **FOLLOW UP:** Clarify the exact data fields for the customer profile endpoint. (No owner assigned)
        *   **FOLLOW UP:** Define the acceptable latency for the account balance endpoint. (No owner assigned)

*   **Technical Debt & Architecture Concerns (David Lee, Omar Hassan)**
    *   David: "We've accumulated a significant amount of technical debt trying to bridge the gap between our platform and the legacy system. We're using a lot of custom middleware and workarounds."
    *   Omar: "The current architecture is a hybrid mess. We have some microservices, but they're heavily coupled to the legacy system's synchronous calls. It's not truly decoupled."
    *   Maria: "And the security layer. We had to implement some custom security checks because the legacy system's authentication mechanism is… rudimentary."
    *   Sarah: "Are we talking about significant rework to address this technical debt?"
    *   David: "Potentially. To truly modernize, we might need to consider a phased approach to replace or abstract more of the legacy functionality. But that's a much larger scope and budget discussion."
    *   **[CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL]** David mentioned a potential alternative architecture that would involve a data replication layer, but it was quickly shut down by Sarah due to budget implications.

*   **Budget & Timeline (Sarah Chen)**
    *   Sarah: "Given these challenges, we need to be realistic about the timeline and budget. We're already seeing some overruns due to the unexpected complexity."
    *   Mr. Tariq: "Overruns? This is concerning. We have a fixed budget."
    *   Sarah: "We're actively managing it, Mr. Tariq. We're exploring options to mitigate the impact."
    *   David: "If we have to re-architect significant portions to address the legacy system's limitations, the timeline and budget will… definitely be impacted."
    *   Maria: "We're spending a lot of time on debugging issues that stem from the legacy system, not our platform."
    *   **FOLLOW UP:** Re-evaluate the project budget based on current challenges. (No owner assigned)

*   **Off-Topic Discussion (Ben Carter)**
    *   Ben: "Speaking of performance, has anyone seen the new load testing tool? It's supposed to be amazing for simulating…"
    *   Sarah: "Ben, let's stick to the agenda for now. We can discuss tools later."

*   **Decisions & Action Items:**

    *   **Decision:** We will proceed with the current architecture, but with a focus on mitigating latency through configuration tuning. (This decision was immediately questioned by David and Omar).
    *   **Decision:** Aisha will work with David to refine the requirements for the customer profile and transaction history endpoints. (Aisha left before this was finalized).
    *   **Action Item:** David to provide a detailed breakdown of the legacy system's performance limitations. (No deadline)
    *   **Action Item:** Maria and Omar to document all custom workarounds and security patches implemented due to legacy system issues. (No deadline)
    *   **Action Item:** Ben to conduct targeted performance tests on the most critical API endpoints. (No deadline)
    *   **Action Item:** Sarah to schedule a follow-up meeting with the client to discuss the challenges and potential scope adjustments. (No date set)

*   **Next Steps:**

    *   Continue development with a focus on mitigating legacy system impacts.
    *   Refine requirements for key endpoints.
    *   Internal team to analyze performance data and identify root causes.
    *   Prepare for client discussion on challenges.

*   **Meeting Adjourned:** 11:35 AM

**Post-Meeting Notes:**

*   Sarah felt the meeting was productive in highlighting the issues, but no concrete solutions were agreed upon.
*   David expressed frustration that the core architectural challenges weren't being addressed more directly.
*   Maria and Omar are concerned about the sustainability of the current approach.
*   Ben is still trying to get a stable environment for his tests.
*   Aisha's departure left some requirement clarifications hanging.
*   Mr. Tariq seemed concerned but didn't offer specific solutions, focusing on the original agreement.
*   The "
[Audio cut out - missed 2 minutes]
decision" to proceed with the current architecture felt like a temporary deferral of a larger problem.
