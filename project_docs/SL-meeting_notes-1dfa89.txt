**Meeting Objective:** To address critical issues impacting the OR Management System implementation and determine immediate next steps.

---

**Discussion Points & Action Items:**

*   **Overall Status Update:**
    *   Sarah Chen: "We're… well, we're here. The system is technically deployed, but the reality on the ground is… challenging."
    *   Mr. Hassan: "Challenging is an understatement, Sarah. We're seeing significant disruption. The integration with the legacy HIS is… problematic."
    *   Ms. Ali: "Problematic? David, you said the data sync was seamless. Now the patient demographics are showing up wrong in the OR schedule. Nurses are having to manually cross-reference everything. It's a nightmare."
    *   Mr. Lee: "The API for the legacy system… it’s not exactly… documented. We made assumptions based on what we could reverse-engineer. Some fields might be mapped incorrectly. We need to revisit the… the data dictionary, if it even exists."
    *   Mr. Javed: "The data dictionary is… somewhere. I think it’s on an old server. We’ll have to dig for it. But the core issue is the real-time sync. It’s not happening. It’s batch, and it’s delayed. That’s why the schedules are out of date."
    *   **FOLLOW UP:** Investigate the legacy HIS data dictionary. (No owner, no deadline)

*   **Integration Gaps:**
    *   Mr. Hassan: "The scheduling module is the biggest pain point. It's not pulling the correct surgeon availability from the physician portal. This

 is causing double-bookings and conflicts."
    *   Ms. Chen: "We flagged this during UAT. David, you said it was a minor configuration issue."
    *   Mr. Lee: "It *was* a configuration issue, but it’s tied to the way the legacy system handles physician credentials. It’s… messy. We’re seeing data corruption on their end when we try to push updates. It’s not just our system, it’s impacting their stability too."
    *   **[CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL]** Dr. Khan: "Impacted stability? This is unacceptable. We need a clear picture of what’s broken and how quickly it can be fixed. What’s the impact on patient safety?"
    *   Ms. Ali: "Patient safety is definitely at risk. If a surgeon isn't listed as available, and they are, or vice versa, it could lead to delays or… worse. We had a near miss yesterday with a critical case."
    *   Mr. Javed: "The vendor’s integration layer… it’s not robust enough for the volume of data. We’re seeing timeouts. And the error logging is… sparse. It’s hard to pinpoint the root cause."
    *   **FOLLOW UP:** Provide a detailed breakdown of all integration gaps and their root causes. (No owner, no deadline)

*   **Timeline Challenges:**
    *   Ms. Chen: "We’re significantly behind schedule. The delays in resolving these integration issues are pushing everything back. The user adoption training, the go-live for the nurse notification module…"
    *   Mr. Hassan: "The original timeline was ambitious to begin with, Sarah. Especially given the constraints of the legacy system. We warned you about this."
    *   Ms. Chen: "And we adjusted the scope based on those warnings. But these new issues… they weren't in the original risk assessment."
    *   **[CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL]** Dr. Khan: "What is the *new* projected go-live date for the nurse notification system? We need this functionality urgently."
    *   Ms. Chen: "It's… fluid. We need to resolve the integration issues first. It’s a dependency."
    *   Mr. Lee: "We’re also facing some… resource constraints on our end. Some key developers are tied up on another critical project. We might need to reallocate resou

rces, but that has budget implications."
    *   **[CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL]** Dr. Khan: "Budget implications? We’re already over budget on this project. We can’t afford further delays or cost overruns."
    *   Mr. Hassan: "The budget was approved based on the original scope and timeline. Any deviation needs a formal change request and justification."

*   **User Adoption Problems:**
    *   Ms. Ali: "The training was… okay. But the system is clunky. The interface isn't intuitive. Nurses are spending more time trying to figure out the system than actually using it. And the constant errors don't help with confidence."
    *   Ms. Sharma: "We received feedback that the navigation could be improved. We planned a follow-up session to address specific user pain points, but with the integration issues, the system isn't stable enough for effective practice."
    *   Mr. Javed: "The shift reporting module… it’s not capturing all the necessary details. Nurses are having to add extra notes manually, which defeats the purpose of a streamlined system."
    *   **[CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL]** Dr. Khan: "Are we sure the training was adequate? Perhaps we need more hands-on sessions, tailored to specific roles."
    *   Ms. Ali: "We need a system that *works* first, Dr. Khan. Then we can focus on adoption. Right now, it’s frustrating. And frankly, some of the older nurses are just reverting to paper."
    *   Mr. Lee: "The performance issues are also a major deterrent. The system lags, especially when trying to access patient history. It’s not a good user experience."

*   **Legacy System Constraints:**
    *   Mr. Hassan: "As we've discussed, the legacy HIS is a significant bottleneck. It's aging, and its architecture is not designed for modern integrations. We’ve been trying to get budget approval for a replacement for years, but…"
    *   Mr. Javed: "The vendor’s approach to integrating with it… it feels like a workaround. We’re building on a shaky foundation. This is technical debt we’re accumulating."
    *   Mr. Lee: "We’re doing our best with the constraints. We’ve implemented caching mechanisms, but it’s not a perfect solution. The underlying data integrity within the legacy system itself is also a concern."
    *   **[CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL]** Dr. Khan: "So, you’re saying our existing system is part of the problem, and your system is struggling to cope?"
    *   Ms. Chen: "We’re highlighting the challenges presented by the legacy system, yes. It’s a significant factor in the integration gaps and performance issues."

*   **Off-Topic Discussion:**
    *   Mr. Javed: "Speaking of legacy systems, did anyone see the new server rack they installed in the data center? It’s… quite something. Much better airflow than the old ones."
    *   Mr. Hassan: "Omar, focus. We’re here to discuss the OR system."
    *   Mr. Javed: "Right, right. Just an observation."

*   **Decisions & Walkbacks:**
    *   *Initial Decision:* The vendor will provide a patch for the physician availability integration by EOD tomorrow.
    *   *Walkback:* Mr. Le
[Side discussion about unrelated budget issues]
e: "Actually, EOD tomorrow might be too aggressive. We need to do more testing. It might be closer to Friday. And we need to confirm the exact scope of the fix with Mr. Javed."
    *   *Initial Decision:* AKUH IT will provide access to the legacy HIS source code for the vendor.
    *   *Walkback:* Mr. Hassan: "We can’t provide source code access. That’s a major security risk. We’ll provide API documentation, what we have of it."

*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Vendor to provide a revised integration plan.
    *   AKUH to identify a point person for legacy system data dictionary retrieval.
    *   Review user feedback and prioritize UI/UX improvements.
    *   Schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss budget implications of potential scope changes.
    *   **FOLLOW UP:** Define a clear communication protocol for critical issues. (No owner, no deadline)
