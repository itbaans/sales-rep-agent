**Important Considerations for the Customer:**

*   **Review Bundles Carefully:** The "broad interpretations" in the Definitions section mean you must scrutinize the specific features and limitations of each Bundle. Do not assume anything.
*   **Clarify Uptime and SLAs:** The "vague SLA details" are a significant risk. Seek precise, measurable, and actionable Uptime guarantees and SLA terms in each Service Order Form.
*   **Understand Variable Costs:** Be prepared for potential increases in Fees due to "variable components." Request detailed breakdowns and clear triggers for these changes.
*   **Termination Clause Risks:** The "ambiguous termination clauses" and "auto-renewal traps" require careful attention. Mark your calendars for renewal notice periods.
*   **Intellectual Property Concerns:** The "gray areas" in IP ownership could lead to disputes. Seek clarity on who owns what, especially for any custom development.
*   **Liability Limitations:** The "limitation of liability favoring vendor" means your recourse for damages is significantly restricted. Understand what is excluded from the cap.
*   **Audit Scope:** The "excessive access" in audit rights could be intrusive. Negotiate reasonable limitations on the scope and frequency of audits.
*   **Change Control Impact:** The "change control procedures that enable scope creep" mean that even minor changes can become costly and time-consuming. Have a strict internal process for managing change requests.
*   **Service Credit Difficulty:** The "service credits that are hard to claim" mean you may not receive compensation even if service levels are not met. Understand the claim process thoroughly.
*   **Data Protection Gaps:** The "data protection compliance gaps" are a critical concern. You are ultimately responsible for your data. Ensure the Provider's practices align with your legal obligations.
*   **Vendor-Friendly Jurisdiction:** Disputes being resolved in the vendor's jurisdiction can be inconvenient and costly for you.

**This framework is designed to highlight potential risks. It is strongly recommended that the Customer consult with legal counsel before signing any Service Order Form or this Framework Agreement.**
