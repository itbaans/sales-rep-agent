## Systems Ltd. - Time & Materials (Hourly) Services Agreement Framework

This document outlines the framework for Services provided by Systems Ltd. ("Provider") to its clients ("Client") under a Time & Materials (Hourly) pricing model. This framework is designed to be adapted for specific engagements, particularly those involving undefined scopes, ongoing support, or ad-hoc change requests.

---

**1. Definitions**

*   **"Services"**: Refers to the professional services, labor, and any associated materials provided by the Provider to the Client as described in a specific Statement of Work (SOW) or agreed-upon engagement. This may include, but is not limited to, consultation, support, development, implementation, and any other activities undertaken by the Provider's personnel.
*   **"Personnel"**: Includes employees, contractors, and agents of the Provider engaged in the performance of the Services.
*   **"Billable Hours"**: Represents the total hours worked by the Provider's Personnel on the Services, as recorded by the Provider. This includes time spent on direct work, communication, planning, and any other activities reasonably associated with the delivery of the Services.
*   **"Materials"**: Encompasses all tangible and intangible items, software, hardware, licenses, or other resources procured or utilized by the Provider in connection with the delivery of the Services.
*   **"Expenses"**: Includes reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Provider's Personnel in connection with the Services, such as travel, accommodation, and other direct costs, subject to the terms herein.
*   **"Statement of Work (SOW)"**: A document that may be issued from time to time, detailing the specific Services to be performed, estimated timelines, and any specific deliverables for a particular engagement.
*
**Audit rights: Quarterly with 30-day notice**
   **"Effective Date"**: The date on which this Agreement or a specific SOW becomes effective.
*   **"Confidential Information"**: Any non-public information disclosed by one party to the other, whether in written, oral, or other form, including but not limited to business plans, technical data, customer lists, and proprietary processes.

**2. Pricing & Payment**

*   **Hourly Rates**: The Client agrees to pay the Provider for all Billable Hours at the Provider's then-current standard hourly rates for the respective Personnel categories. These rates are subject to change upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the Client. *[Hidden Risk: Rate range approximate, internal variations apply; specific rates will be detailed in the SOW but are subject to Provider's internal adjustments.]*
*   **Materials and Expenses**: The Client shall reimburse the Provider for all Materials and Expenses incurred in connection with the Services. The Provider may apply a reasonable markup to Materials and Expenses to cover administrative and overhead costs. *[Hidden Risk: Expense markup unspecified; Provider reserves the right to apply a "reasonable" markup, which is open to interpretation and potential disputes.]*
*   **Invoicing**: The Provider shall invoice the Client on a [weekly/bi-weekly/monthly] basis for Services rendered, Materials, and Expenses incurred during the preceding billing period. Invoices are due and payable within [15/30] days of the invoice date.
*   **Late Payments**: Late payments may be subject to interest at a rate of [1.5%] per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower.
*   **Disputed Charges**: The Client must notify the Provider in writing of any disputed charges within [7] days of receiving the invoice. Failure to do so will be deemed acceptance of the invoice. *[Hidden Risk: Short dispute window limits Client's ability to thoroughly review and challenge charges.]*

**3. Term & Termination**

*   **Term**: This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue until terminated in accordance with its terms. *[Hidden Risk: Auto-renewal traps - This framework does not explicitly detail an auto-renewal clause, but i
[NOTE: Rate range approximate, internal variations apply; expense markup unspecified affects this section]
t is implied that the agreement continues indefinitely until actively terminated, potentially leading to ongoing, unmanaged costs.]*
*   **Termination for Convenience**: Either party may terminate this Agreement or any SOW for convenience upon providing [60] days' written notice to the other party. *[Hidden Risk: Ambiguous termination clauses - While a notice period is provided, the consequences of termination for convenience, such as payment for work in progress or unrecoverable costs, are not explicitly defined, leaving room for Provider to claim significant costs.]*
*   **Termination for Cause**: Either party may terminate this Agreement or any SOW immediately upon written notice if the other party materially breaches any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within [30] days of receiving written notice thereof.
*   **Effect of Termination**: Upon termination, the Client shall pay the Provider for all Services rendered and Expenses incurred up to the effective date of termination, including any non-cancellable commitments made by the Provider in reliance on the continuation of the Services. *[Hidden Risk: Ambiguous termination clauses - This clause can be interpreted broadly to include costs not directly tied to completed work, such as unamortized setup costs or projected future expenses.]*

**4. Warranties**

*   **Service Performance**: The Provider warrants that the Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner, consistent with industry standards. *[Hidden Risk: Limited and conditional - This is a general warranty and does not guarantee specific outcomes or performance metrics, especially given the undefined scope.]*
*   **Materials**: The Provider warrants that any materials provided by the Provider will be free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of [30] days from delivery. *[Hidden Risk: Limited and conditional - This warranty is very short and only applies to materials provided by the Provider, not any third-party software or hardware the Client may already possess or procure.]*
*   **Exclusions**: The warranties set forth in this Section 4 do not apply to any Services or Materials that have been modified, misused, or subjected to abnormal operating conditions by the Client or any third party. *[Hidden Risk: Limited and conditional - This broad exclusion clause allows the Provider to disclaim responsibi
**Audit rights: Quarterly with 30-day notice**
lity for many potential issues by attributing them to Client misuse or external factors.]*
*   **Sole Remedy**: The Client's sole and exclusive remedy for breach of warranty shall be, at the Provider's option, to re-perform the non-confo

rming Services or replace the defective Materials.

**5. Liability**

*   **Limitation of Liability**: To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall the Provider, its affiliates, or its suppliers be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, data, or use, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Services, even if the Provider has been advised of the possibility of such damages. *[Hidden Risk: Limitation of liability favoring vendor - This clause broadly excludes many types of damages, including those that might arise from the Provider's negligence or gross negligence, and the cap below further limits recourse.]*
*   **Aggregate Liability Cap**: The Provider's total aggregate liability to the Client for any and all claims arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Services, regardless of the form of action, shall not exceed the total amount paid by the Client to the Provider under this Agreement during the [six (6)] months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim. *[Hidden Risk: Limitation of liability favoring vendor - This cap is based on a short preceding period and excludes key items like intellectual property infringement claims or breaches of confidentiality, leaving the Client with minimal recourse for significant damages.]*
*   **Exclusions from Cap**: The limitations of liability set forth in this Section 5 shall not apply to: (a) breaches of confidentiality obligations; (b) indemnification obligations; (c) gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Provider; or (d) claims for death or personal injury caused by the Provider's negligence. *[Hidden Risk: Limitation of liability favoring vendor - While these exclusions exist, proving gross negligence or willful misconduct can be challenging, and the cap still significantly limits recovery for most other types of damages.]*

**6. Governing Law**

*   **Jurisdiction**: This Agreement and any disputes arising out of or in connection with it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [Provider's State/Country], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. *[Hidden Risk: Governing law favoring vendor location - This clause dictates that any legal disputes will be handled in the Provider's home jurisdiction, which may be inconvenient and 
<!-- IP ownership remains with Systems Ltd for custom developments -->
costly for the Client to pursue legal action.]*
*   **Dispute Resolution**: Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach, termination, or invalidity thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the [Arbitration Association in Provider's Jurisdiction] in accordance with its [Arbitration Rules]. The place of arbitration shall be [City in Provider's Jurisdiction]. The language of the arbitration shall be English. *[Hidden Risk: Dispute resolution favoring vendor location - Arbitration in the Provider's jurisdiction further disadvantages the Client by imposing location and procedural burdens.]*

**Additional Framework Components (To be detailed in SOWs):**

*   **Intellectual Property Ownership**: Unless otherwise expressly agreed in a specific SOW, any intellectual property developed by the Provider during the performance of the Services shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Provider. The Client may be granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use such intellectual property solely in connection with the Services. *[Hidden Risk: Intellectual property ownership gray areas - This default position heavily favors the Provider, potentially leaving the Client with no ownership of custom-developed solutions, even if they paid for them.]*
*   **Change Control**: Any changes to the scope of Services, deliverables, or timelines must be documented in a written Change Order, signed by both parties. Th
[CLAUSE: Liability capped at fees paid, excluding IP infringement]
e Provider reserves the right to assess the impact of any change request on the overall cost and timeline of the Services. *[Hidden Risk: Change control procedures that enable scope creep - While a formal process is mentioned, the lack of strict controls on what constitutes a "change" and the Provider's ability to unilaterally assess impact can lead to uncontrolled scope expansion and cost increases.]*
*   **Service Credits**: In the event of a failure by the Provider to meet specific, measurable service levels (if defined in an SOW), the Client may be eligible for service credits. Such credits are typically a small percentage of the monthly service fee and are subject to strict claim procedures and limitations. *[Hidden Risk: Service credits that are hard to claim - Service level agreements (SLAs) are often absent or vaguely defined in T&M engagements. When present, the conditions for claiming credits are usually stringent, requiring extensive documentation and proof, making them difficult to obtain.]*
*   **Data Protection**: The Provider will comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations in the processing of Client data. However, specific data handling procedures, security measures, and responsibilities will be detailed in a separate Data Processing Addendum (DPA) or within the SOW. *[Hidden Risk: Data protection compliance gaps - Without a robust, specific DPA, there can be ambiguity regarding data ownership, processing limitations, and the Provider's responsibilities in case of a data breach, potentially leaving the Client exposed.]*
*   **Audit Rights**: The Provider reserves the right to audit the Client's records and systems to verify compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to, the accuracy of reported Billable Hours and the proper use of any licensed materials. *[Hidden Risk: Audit rights with excessive access - The Provider's audit rights may be overly broad, granting them extensive access to the Client's internal systems and data, potentially compromising the Client's privacy and security.]*
