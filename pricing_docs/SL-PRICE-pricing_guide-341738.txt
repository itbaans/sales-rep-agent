## Systems Ltd. Hybrid Pricing Model: A Comprehensive Guide

**Version 1.0 | Date: October 26, 2023**

---

### 1. Overview: Unlocking Value with Flexible Solutions

Systems Ltd. is proud to introduce our innovative **Hybrid Pricing Model**, designed to offer unparalleled flexibility and value for your critical business initiatives. This model seamlessly blends the predictability of fixed-fee engagements with the agility of time-and-materials (T&M) or performance-based structures. By leveraging this approach, we empower your organization to achieve ambitious goals, from complex ERP implementations to cutting-edge AI deployments, while ensuring cost-effectiveness and a clear path to measurable success.

**Key Benefits:**

*   **Predictable Foundation:** A fixed fee component provides a solid baseline for project planning and budget allocation.
*   **Agile Adaptation:** T&M or performance-based elements allow for dynamic adjustments and optimization as your needs evolve.
*   **Value Alignment:** Performance bonuses directly link our success to your achieved business outcomes.
*   **Comprehensive Support:** Seamlessly integrate post-go-live support and ongoing maintenance within a unified pricing framework.
*   **Future-Proofing:** Ideal for scalable solutions like AI pilot programs that transition into full-scale deployments.

### 2. Rate Structure: Navigating Our Flexible Framework

Systems Ltd. does not adhere to a rigid, standardized rate card for our Hybrid Pricing Model. Instead, we believe in a highly customized approach tailored to the unique demands of each project. Our pricing is built upon a foundation of **estimated effort and resource allocation**, which translates into a flexible range of financial commitments.

**General Indicative Ranges (Subject to Project Scope & Complexity):**

*   **Fixed Fee Component:** Typically represents a significant portion of the initial project investment, covering defined deliverables and milestones. Expect this to fall within a broad spectrum, often ranging from **$50,000 to $500,000+** for initial phases.
*   **Time & Materials (T&M) / Support Component:** This variable element is billed based on actual hours worked by our expert teams. Hourly rates are not publicly disclosed and are determined on a case-by-case basis, generally falling within the **$150 - $400+ per hour** range, depending on the skill set and seniority of the resources involved.
*   **Performance Bonus Component:** This is a success-based incentive, typically structured as a percentage of the fixed fee or a pre-defined uplift based on achieving specific, mutually agreed-upon Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This can range from **5% to 25%** of the base project cost.

**Footnotes:**

*   ¹ **Resource Specialization:** Highly specialized or niche skill sets may command rates at the higher end of the indicative ranges.
*   ² **Geographic Location of Resources:** The cost of living and prevailing market rates in different regions can influence the T&M component.
*   ³ **Project Complexity & Risk:** Projects with higher inherent risk or intricate technical challenges may necessitate adjustments to the pricing structure.

### 3. Suitable Use Cases: Empowering Your Digital Transformation

The Systems Ltd. Hybrid Pricing Model is exceptionally well-suited for a wide array of strategic initiatives, offering a robust framework for success.

**Primary Applications:**

*   **ERP Implementations with Post-Go-Live Support:** A fixed fee for the core implementation phase, followed by a T&M or retainer-based support structure for ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and minor enhancements.
*   **AI Pilot Programs & Scale-Out:** An initial fixed fee for the proof-of-concept and pilot phase, with a T&M or performance-based component for scaling the solution and optimizing its impact.
*   **Custom Software Development with Ongoing Maintenance:** A fixed fee for the initial development cycle, transitioning to a support agreement for continuous improvement and operational stability.
*   **Digital Transformation Initiatives:** A flexible approach to manage evolving project scopes and deliver incremental value throughout the transformation journey.

**Broad Applicability:**

While the above represent our most common engagements, the inherent flexibility of the Hybrid Pricing Model allows for adaptation to virtually any complex technology project where a blend of upfront planning and ongoing adaptability is desired.

### 4. Contractual Considerations: Navigating the Nuances

Our Hybrid Pricing Model is inherently **customized and contract-specific**. While we strive for clarity, certain elements are always subject to negotiation and require careful review.

**"Standard" Negotiated Terms:**

*   **Scope Definition:** While we provide initial scope outlines, the precise boundaries and deliverables are always a point of discussion and refinement.
*   **Milestone Definitions & Payment Triggers:** The specific criteria for milestone completion and associated payment schedules are collaboratively defined.
*   **Change Order Process:** The methodology for managing and pricing scope changes is a critical element of negotiation.
*   **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Specific performance metrics and response times for support components are always tailored.
*   **Intellectual Property (IP) Ownership:** The terms surrounding IP ownership are a key contractual discussion.

**Hidden Cost Components (Considerations):**

*   **Third-Party Software Licensing:** Costs associated with any third-party software or tools required for the solution are typically passed through.
*   **Infrastructure & Hosting:** While not directly part of our service fee, the cost of necessary cloud or on-premise infrastructure is a project consideration.
*   **Travel & Expenses:** For on-site engagements, travel and accommodation expenses are billed separately and are subject to pre-approval.
*   **Data Migration Complexity:** The effort involved in migrating existing data can significantly impact the T&M component.
*   **Training & User Adoption:** While often included in the fixed fee, extensive or specialized training programs may incur additional costs.

### 5. Regional Variations: A Global Perspective

Systems Ltd. operates globally, and our pricing structures can be influenced by regional economic factors and tax regulations.

**General Considerations:**

*   **Value-Added Tax (VAT) / Goods and Services Tax (GST):** Applicable taxes will be added to invoices in accordance with local legislation. The specific rates and applicability vary significantly by country and are not fully detailed herein.
*   **Currency Fluctuations:** For international projects, currency exchange rates may be a factor in the final billing.
*   **Local Labor Costs:** The cost of skilled resources can differ considerably across regions, impacting the T&M component.

**Note:** It is the client's responsibility to understand and account for all applicable regional taxes and duties. We recommend consulting with your local tax advisor for specific guidance.

**Q2: What happens if the project takes longer than initially estimated under the T&M component?**

**A2:** The T&M component is designed for flexibility. If the project requires more time than initially projected, billing will continue based on actual hours worked. This is why clear scope management and regular progress reviews are crucial.

**Q3: Can we negotiate a
