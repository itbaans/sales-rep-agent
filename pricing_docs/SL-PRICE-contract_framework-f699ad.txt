## Systems Ltd. Cost-Plus Pricing Framework Agreement

This Framework Agreement ("Agreement") outlines the terms and conditions under which Systems Ltd. ("Provider") will provide services to its clients ("Client") utilizing a Cost-Plus Pricing model. This framework is designed for large Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) deals and long-term support contracts.

---

**1. Definitions**

For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them herein:

*   **"Services"**: Refers to the business process outsourcing, support, or other related services to be provided by the Provider to the Client as detailed in individual Statements of Work ("SOWs") or similar appended documents. The scope of "Services" is inherently broad and may encompass any activities reasonably related to the Client's business objectives as determined by the Provider.
*   **"Costs"**: Encompasses all direct and indirect expenses incurred by the Provider in the provision of the Services. This includes, but is not limited to, personnel costs (salaries, benefits, contractor fees), operational expenses (rent, utilities, software licenses, hardware depreciation), third-party vendor costs, travel and accommodation, training, and any other expenditure deemed necessary or beneficial by the Provider for the successful execution of the Services. The determination of what constitutes a "Cost" and its allocation to the Services shall be at the sole discretion of the Provider.
*   **"Markup"**: A percentage applied to the total "Costs" to determine the final price for the Services. The specific Markup percentage will be communicated to the Client in the relevant SOW and may vary based on the overall deal size and duration, with larger deals potentially benefiting from a lower, albeit still profitable, Markup band.
*   **"Effective Date"**: The date on which the Client formally accepts this Framework Agreement, typically indicated by signature or commencement of Services under an initial SOW.
*   **"Confidential Information"**: Any and all information, in whatever form or medium, disclosed by one Party to the other, which is either designated as confidential or which, by its nature, should reasonably be understood to be confidential. This includes, but is not limited to, business plans, financial data, customer lists, technical specifications, methodologies, and any information related to the Provider's proprietary processes and operational efficiencies.
*   **"Intellectual Property"**: All inventions, discoveries, designs, processes, formulas, data, software, algorithms, methodologies, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, patents, and any other proprietary rights, whether registered or unregistered, existing or hereafter created, in any jurisdiction, related to the Services or the Provider's business operations.
*   **"Service Credits"**: A monetary credit applied to future invoices as a remedy for specific, defined Service Level Agreement ("SLA") breaches, as outlined in an applicable SOW.
*   **"Term"**: The duration of this Agreement, as specified in Section 3.
*   **"Dispute"**: Any disagreement, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Services, or the breach, termination, or validity thereof.

**2. Pricing & Payment**

*   **2.1 Pricing Model**: The Services will be priced on a Cost-Plus basis. The final price for any given period will be calculated as: **Total Costs + (Total Costs x Markup Percentage)**.
*   **2.2 Cost Inclusions**: As defined in Section 1, "Costs" are broadly interpreted and include all direct and indirect expenses incurred by the Provider. The Provider reserves the right to include reasonable overhead allocations, administrative fees, and any other expenses it deems necessary to support the Services.
*   **2.3 Markup Bands**: The Markup percentage will be determined by the Provider based on the overall value and complexity of the Client's engagement. While specific percentages are not fixed herein, they will be communicated in the relevant SOW. The Provider may adjust these bands for new SOWs or significant changes in scope.
*   **2.4 Invoicing**: The Provider shall issue invoices to the Client on a [Monthly/Bi-weekly] basis, detailing the Services rendered and the associated Costs. Invoices will be based on the Provider's internal accounting records, which may not be readily accessible or fully transparent to the Client.
*   **2.5 Payment Terms**: Payment is due within [15/30] days of the invoice date. Late payments may be subject to interest at a rate of [1.5%/month] or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower.
*   **2.6 Variable Components**: The Provider reserves the right to adjust pricing for variable components of "Costs" (e.g., third-party software licenses, currency fluctuations) with [30] days' written notice. The Client acknowledges that the total "Costs" may fluctuate significantly based on these variables.
*   **2.7 Audit Rights**: The Client shall have the right to audit the Provider's records pertaining to the Services provided under this Agreement, subject to the following conditions:
    *   Audits must be conducted during the Provider's normal business hours and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the Provider's operations.
    *   The Client shall provide at least [30] days' prior written notice of its intent to conduct an audit.
    *   The scope of the audit shall be limited to the "Costs" directly attributable to the Services provided to the Client under this Agreement.
    *   The Provider reserves the right to limit the scope of the audit to specific categories of costs or to provide summarized reports instead of full access to all underlying documentation.
    *   The Client shall bear all costs associated with any audit. If an audit reveals an overcharge of more than [5%] in favor of the Provider, the Provider will reimburse the Client for the excess amount and the reasonable cost of the audit. If the overcharge is [5%] or less, the Client shall bear the cost of the audit.
    *   The Provider may require the Client to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) prior to commencing any audit.

The Client acknowledges that failure to provide timely notice of non-renewal will result in continued service and billing.

*   **3.5 Ambiguous Termination Clauses**:
    *   **"Material Breach"**: The definition of "material breach" is not exhaustively defined and shall be interpreted by the Provider in good faith, considering the overall intent and operational impact of the alleged breach.
    *   **"Cure Period"**: The [30]-day cure period may be extended at the Provider's sole discretion if the Provider deems the breach to be complex or requiring significant effort to rectify.
    *   **"Force Majeure"**: The Provider shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement if such delay or failure is caused by events beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, civil unrest, labor disputes, or governmental actions. The Provider will provide reasonable notice of such events.
