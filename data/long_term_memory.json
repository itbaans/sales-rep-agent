    "summary": "Jennifer, VP of Engineering, is in the \"interest\" stage and exploring Data & AI, Cloud Services, and AI integration into their patient management system. She has high decision-making authority but the conversation ended abruptly, potentially indicating a need for more information or a better value proposition. Key pain points are still undefined, but she asked specific technical questions about AI integration, signaling strong interest. We provided relevant documentation, including details on our \"Hami\" AI physician assistant app. While no explicit objections were raised, the abrupt ending suggests a possible lack of urgency (urgency score: 3). Qualification is moderate (budget: 5, authority: 8, urgency: 3, engagement: 4). Next steps should focus on addressing her technical questions, highlighting the value of AI integration, and re-engaging her interest. Follow up in 1-3 days, emphasizing the technical aspects and benefits of our AI and cloud solutions.",
