    "summary": "Jennifer is currently in the objection handling stage, but the conversation ended abruptly and engagement is low. She's a high-level decision maker, but urgency is low and budget is unconfirmed. She showed initial interest in Data & AI, Cloud Services, and integrating AI into her patient management system, asking technical questions about requirements and implementation. We provided documentation on Managed Services, ERP Integration, DevOps, and our 'Hami' AI physician assistant. However, she didn't engage with the 'Hami' details and the conversation was derailed by irrelevant questions. We need to re-engage her, address the lack of interest in 'Hami', and determine if the Mongolia question was a genuine query or a sign of a bot. Next steps should focus on re-establishing value and potentially re-qualifying the lead. Follow up in 1-3 days with a more targeted approach, possibly focusing on specific technical aspects of AI integration that address her initial questions.",

They're experiencing pain points around AI-driven triage, physician intake assistance, and patient engagement, all of which our solutions address. They're particularly interested in AI integration into their patient management system. While their authority level is medium, their engagement is high, demonstrated by their technical questions about the Hami project's tech stack and implementation. We need to address their initial concern about the Hami project's implementation timeline. The next step is to schedule the demo they requested for next week, focusing on our experience in healthcare AI and highlighting the Hami project's benefits in patient engagement, AI-driven triage, and physician intake assistance.",
