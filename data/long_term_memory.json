    "summary": "Jennifer, VP of Engineering, expressed interest in our medicine inventory management system and other solutions like ERP implementation and digital portals. We're at the \"interest\" stage, and while she has high decision-making authority, urgency and engagement are moderate. No budget or timeline was confirmed. She asked about our company and how we can help with inventory management. We provided company and technical capability documents. No objections were raised, but she didn't commit to specific next steps, only saying she'd contact us later. Follow up in 1-3 days to maintain engagement. Be prepared to address potential concerns about project management and integration delays, and re-emphasize the value of our inventory management system.",
