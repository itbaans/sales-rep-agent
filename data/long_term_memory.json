    "summary": "Okay, here's a sales-focused summary based on the lead memory data:\n\n\"We're in the discovery phase with Jennifer Martinez, VP of Engineering. She has high decision-making authority, but engagement and urgency seem low. We addressed her initial question about Systems Limited's value proposition by providing our company profile and case studies, highlighting the Aga Khan University Hospital project as particularly relevant. While budget *appears* to be a fit, the conversation ended abruptly, suggesting a potential lack of immediate interest. The primary objection to address is her perceived lack of time or urgency. Next steps are to follow up within 1-3 days, re-engaging her with a concise, value-driven message that directly addresses her initial question and emphasizes the benefits of our solutions for her specific needs. We need to uncover her specific pain points and timeline to improve qualification.\"",
