    "summary": "Jennifer is currently in the objection handling stage, but the conversation ended abruptly and engagement is low. She's a high-level decision maker, but urgency is low and budget is unconfirmed. She showed initial interest in Data & AI, Cloud Services, and integrating AI into her patient management system, asking technical questions about requirements and implementation. We provided documentation on Managed Services, ERP Integration, DevOps, and our 'Hami' AI physician assistant. However, she didn't engage with the 'Hami' details and the conversation was derailed by irrelevant questions. We need to re-engage her, address the lack of interest in 'Hami', and determine if the Mongolia question was a genuine query or a sign of a bot. Next steps should focus on re-establishing value and potentially re-qualifying the lead. Follow up in 1-3 days with a more targeted approach, possibly focusing on specific technical aspects of AI integration that address her initial questions.",
