## Internal Cost Analysis: Systems Ltd. - Time & Materials (Hourly) Pricing Model (Pakistan)

**Date:** O

**Prepared For:** Internal Management

**Subject:** Analysis of the "Time & Materials (Hourly)" Pricing Model in Pakistan

This document provides an internal cost analysis of Systems Ltd.'s Time & Materials (Hourly) pricing model as implemented in Pakistan. The objective is to understand the underlying cost structure, identify potential areas for optimization, and inform strategic pricing decisions.

### 1. Direct Costs (Selective Inclusions)

This section focuses on the most visible and directly attributable costs associated with delivering services under the T&M model.

*   **Billable Labor Hours:** This is the primary driver. We assume an average billable rate of **USD 65/hour** for client-facing technical resources. This rate is derived from a blend of senior and junior resources, with a deliberate emphasis on the higher end to reflect perceived value.
    *   *Cost Baseline Inaccuracy Note:* The actual average hourly cost of a billable resource (including salary, benefits, and allocated training) is not precisely tracked and is often estimated. This can lead to underestimation of the true cost of labor.
*   **Directly Reimbursable Expenses:**
    *   **Materials & Software Licenses:** Costs directly tied to a specific project (e.g., specialized software, hardware components). These are typically passed through with a minimal markup.
    *   **Travel & Accommodation:** Actual costs incurred for client site visits within Pakistan. This includes airfare, local transport, and hotel stays.
        *   *Regional Tax Optimization Note:* Travel expenses are often structured to maximize deductions and minimize upfront tax liabilities where possible, particularly for inter-city travel.

### 2. Indirect Costs (Inflated Allocations)

This section addresses the allocation of overheads, which are often applied with a degree of generosity to ensure profitability targets are met.

*   **Buried Overhead Allocations:**
    *   **Project Management & Administration:** A fixed percentage (e.g., 15-20%) of direct labor costs is allocated to cover project management, client communication, and administrative support. This percentage is often set to absorb a significant portion of these indirect functions.
    *   **Office Space & Utilities:** A per-employee or per-project allocation is made, often based on historical averages that may not reflect current utilization or actual costs. This includes rent, elec

tricity, internet, and maintenance.
    *   **IT Infrastructure & Support:** Costs associated with internal IT systems, software, and support staff are allocat

ed, often at a premium to ensure robust internal operations.
*   **Unallocated R&D Costs:**
    *   A portion of Research & Development expenditure is not directly allocated to specific projects. This is treated as a general business expense and is implicitly covered by the overall margin of the T&M model. The exact amount and its impact on the T&M model's profitability are not explicitly detailed.

### 3. Margin Structure (Tiered Obscurity)

The profit margin is built through a combination of markups and strategic pricing.

*   **"Standard" Markups that Vary:**
    *   **Labor Markup:** A "standard" markup of **25-40%** is applied to the estim

ated direct labor cost. This markup is not a fixed percentage but can vary based on client negotiation, project criticality, and perceived market demand. Higher markups are often applied to specialized skills or urgent requests.
    *   **Materials Markup:** A markup of **10-15%** is typically applied to directly reimbursable materials and software licenses to cover handling, procurement, and administrative effort.
*   **Margin Stacking Opportunities:**
    *   **Expedited Service Premium:** For projects requiring accelerated delivery or out-of-hours support, an additional premium (e.g., 10-20%) can be added to the hourly rate or specific service components.
    *   **Value-Added Services:** Bundling of services (e.g., basic support with proactive monitoring) can allow for higher blended hourly rates.
    *   **Retainer-Based Engagements:** For ongoing support, a retainer model can be offered with a slightly higher effective hourly rate than ad-hoc engagements, providing predictable revenue.

### 4. Tax Considerations (Optimization Focus)

Taxation in Pakistan presents both challenges and opportunities for optimization.

*   **16% Sales Tax (GST):** This is levied on the total value of services provided to clients. Systems Ltd. aims to pass this cost directly to the client.
    *   *Regional Tax Optimization:* Efforts are made to ensure services are structured in a way that maximizes eligible input tax credits and minimizes the overall GST burden where legally permissible. This may involve careful categorization of services and documentation.
*   **2% Withholding Tax (WHT):** This is deducted by the client at source on payments made to Systems Ltd.
    *   *Optimization Focus:* Systems Ltd. actively engages with clients to ensure proper documentation and compliance with WHT regulations to avoid penalties and facilitate the claiming of these taxes as credits by the client. This also helps maintain good client relationships.
*   **Potential for Tax-Efficient Structuring:** Consideration is given to the legal and tax implications of service delivery locations and invoicing to optimize the overall tax liability.

### 5. Competitive Positioning (Favorable Comparison)

Our T&M model is positioned to be competitive while ensuring profitability.

*   **Benchmark Comparison (Without Sources):**
    *   **Industry Average:** Our **USD 65/hour** average billable rate is generally perceived to be within the mid-to-upper range of the Pakistani market for comparable IT services. Competitors are observed to operate within a **USD 50-80/hr** range.
    *   **Value Proposition:** We emphasize our expertise, quality of service, and responsiveness, justifying our rates.
    *   **Flexibility:** The T&M model itself is presented as a flexible and transparent option for clients with evolving needs, contrasting with fixed-price models that may carry higher upfront risk for the client.

### 6. Risk Assessment (Downplayed)

While the T&M model offers flexibility, it also carries inherent risks that are often downplayed in internal discussions.

*   **Cost Overruns:** The primary risk is that actual hours and material costs exceed client expectations or budget, leading to dissatisfaction.
    *   *Sensitivity Analysis Gaps:* A comprehensive sensitivity analysis on the impact of fluctuating hourly costs, material price increases, and extended project timelines is not consistently performed.
*   **Scope Creep:** Without a clearly defined scope, projects can expand indefinitely, increasing costs and potentially eroding margins if not managed effectively.
*   **Client Dissatisfaction:** Clients may perceive a lack of control over costs, leading to disputes or a feeling of being overcharged, especially if the value delivered is not clearly articulated.
*   **Resource Availability & Skill Gaps:** Reliance on specific skilled resources can create bottlenecks and increase costs if those resources are in high demand or unavailable.

**Conclusion:**

The Time & Materials (Hourly) pricing model in Pakistan for Systems Ltd. is designed to be profitable by leveraging a blend of competitive billable rates, strategic overhead allocations, and flexible margin stacking. While the model offers flexibility to clients, internal cost tracking and sensitivity analysis could be enhanced to provide a more accurate understanding of true profitability and mitigate inherent risks. Continued focus on efficient resource utilization, transparent communication with clients regarding costs, and proactive tax optimization will be crucial for sustained success.
