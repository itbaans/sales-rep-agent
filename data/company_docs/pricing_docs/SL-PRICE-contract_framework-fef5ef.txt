*   **"Performance Fee"**: The compensation payable to the Vendor, calculated as a percentage of the realized cost savings or increased revenue, or based on other agreed-upon performance metrics as detailed in the relevant SOW. The calculation methodology for the Performance Fee is subject to the Vendor's proprietary algorithms and methodologies.
