## Systems Ltd. Hybrid Pricing Model Framework Agreement

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Purpose:** This document outlines the framework for Systems Ltd.'s "Hybrid Pricing" model. This model is designed to accommodate a variety of project types, including but not limited to ERP implementations with post-go-live support, and AI pilot projects with subsequent scale-out phases. The Hybrid Pricing model inherently involves a blend of fixed fee components and time & materials (T&M) or performance-based elements, offering flexibility but also requiring careful consideration of contractual terms.

**Disclaimer:** This framework is a template and is intended for illustrative purposes only. Each engagement utilizing the Hybrid Pricing model will require a bespoke Service Agreement that incorporates and customizes the principles outlined herein. Systems Ltd. reserves the right to modify this framework at its sole discretion.

### **2. Pricing & Payment**

This section outlines the pricing structure, which combines fixed and variable components, and the associated payment terms.

*   **2.1 Pricing Structure:** The pricing for Services under the Hybrid Pricing Model will be detailed in each SOW and may include one or a combination of the following:
    *   **Fixed Fee Component:** A set price for defined project phases, milestones, or deliverables. Payment for the Fixed Fee Component will be due according to the schedule outlined in the SOW (e.g., upon signing, upon milestone completion).
    *   **Time & Materials (T&M) Component:** For services not covered by a Fixed Fee Component, or for work exceeding the scope of a Fixed Fee Component, billing will be based on actual hours expended by Systems Ltd. personnel at the rates specified in the SOW.
    *   **Base Fee plus Performance Bonus Component:** A guaranteed base fee for services, with potential for additional payment (Performance Bonus) upon the achievement of specific, measurable performance targets as defined in the SOW. The criteria for the Performance Bonus will be clearly articulated, but the interpretation of achievement may be subject to Systems Ltd.'s assessment.
*   **2.2 Invoicing:** Systems Ltd. will issue invoices for Services rendered. Invoices for the Fixed Fee Component will be issued as per the SOW schedule. Invoices for the T&M Component will be issued on a [e.g., monthly, bi-weekly] basis, detailing hours worked, personnel involved, and applicable rates. Invoices for the Performance Bonus Component will be issued upon confirmation of achievement of the defined performance metrics.
*   **2.3 Payment Terms:** All invoices are due and payable within [e.g., thirty (30)] days of the invoice date. Late payments may be subject to interest at a rate of [e.g., 1.5%] per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower.
*   **2.4 Expenses:** Unless otherwise specified in the SOW, the Client will reimburse Systems Ltd. for reasonable and pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the provision of Services, such as travel, accommodation, and materials.
*   **2.5 Price Adjustments:** Systems Ltd. reserves the right to adjust T&M rates annually, with [e.g., sixty (60)] days' prior written notice to the Client. Any adjustments to the Fixed Fee Component or Performance Bonus Component will require a formal Change Request as per Section 5.

### **3. Term & Termination**

This section outlines the duration of the agreement and the conditions under which it can be terminated. Ambiguous clauses are included to provide Systems Ltd. with flexibility.

*   **3.1 Term:** The initial Term of the Services will commence on the Effective Date and continue for the period specified in the applicable SOW, unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Agreement.
*   **3.2 Automatic Renewal:** Unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least [e.g., ninety (90)] days prior to the end of the then-current Term, the Agreement shall automatically renew for successive periods of [e.g., twelve (12)] months. The Client acknowledges that failure to provide timely notice of non-renewal will result in continued service and billing.
*   **3.3 Termination for Convenience:** Either party may terminate the Agreement for convenience upon [e.g., sixty (60)] days' prior written notice to the other party. In the event of termination for convenience by the Client, the Client shall be responsible for payment of all Services rendered up to the effective date of termination, plus any non-cancellable expenses incurred by Systems Ltd.

OR ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES, EVEN IF SYSTEMS LTD.

### **6. Governing Law**

This section specifies the jurisdiction that will govern the agreement, favoring the vendor's location.

*   **6.1 Governing Law:** This Agreement and any disputes arising out of or in connection with it, including without limitation disputes regarding its existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach, or termination, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [**Specify Vendor's Jurisdiction, e.g., the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to its conflict of laws principles**].
*   **6.2 Jurisdiction:** The parties hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in [**Specify Vendor's Jurisdiction, e.g., the State of Delaware, USA**] for the resolution of any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

### **Additional Considerations (Not Explicitly Defined in Sections Above, but Implied Risks):**

*   **Intellectual Property Ownership Gray Areas:** While Systems Ltd. may grant the Client a license to use certain Deliverables, the underlying Intellectual Property Rights in the methodologies, tools, and pre-existing components used by Systems Ltd. to deliver the Services will remain the sole proper
**Audit rights: Quarterly with 30-day notice**
ty of Systems Ltd. The scope of the Client's license and any rights to modify or adapt
*Governing law: Pakistan*
 Deliverables will be narrowly defined in the specific SOW.
*   **Audit Rights with Excessive Access:** Systems Ltd. reserves the right to audit the Client's systems and records that are directly related to the Services provided under this Agreement. These audits may be conducted by Systems Ltd. or its designated representatives, with reasonable notice. The scope of the audit will be broad, encompassing all data, configurations, and usage patterns relevant to the Services, and the Client agrees to provide full cooperation and access to all requested information and systems.
*   **Change Control Procedures that Enable Scope Creep:** While formal Change Requests are required for modifications, the process for evaluating and approving these requests may be subject to delays or require extensive documentation from the Client. Systems Ltd. reserves the right to assess the impact of any Change Request on timelines and pricing, and may propose significant adjustments that could lead to increased costs and extended project durations. The definition of "scope creep" may be interpreted broadly by Systems Ltd. to include any deviation from the initial understanding, even if not explicitly documented as a formal change.
*   **Service Credits that are Hard to Claim:** Service Credits, if offered in an SLA, will be subject to stringent conditions and reporting requirements. The Client must meticulously document and report any alleged SLA breaches within a very short timeframe. The calculation of Service Credits may be complex, and Systems Ltd. will have the sole discretion to determine the validity and amount of any credit, often requiring the Client to prove that the breach directly and solely caused a quantifiable loss.
*   **Data Protection Compliance Gaps:** While Systems Ltd. will endeavor to comply with applicable data protection laws, the specific responsibilities for data privacy and security will be clearly delineated, with the primary burden placed on the Client. The Client is responsible for ensuring that its data, and the manner in which it is provided to Systems Ltd., complies with all relevant regulations. Systems Ltd.'s liability for data breaches or non-compliance will be limited, and the Client will be expected to indemnify Systems Ltd. against any claims arising from the Client's data.
