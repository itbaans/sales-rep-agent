**IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS FOR CLIENTS:**

*   **Review Definitions Carefully:** The broad interpretations of terms like "Services" and "Allocated Capacity" can lead to unexpected costs or limitations.
*   **Understand Termination Clauses:** The auto-renewal trap and the notice periods for termination for convenience are critical.
*   **Scrutinize Liability Limitations:** The cap on liability and its exclusions are heavily skewed in favor of the vendor.
*   **Question Audit Rights:** The potential for excessive access and the cost implications of discrepancies should be carefully considered.
*   **Be Wary of Change Control:** The process is designed to facilitate scope creep, which can significantly increase costs.
*   **Service Credits are Difficult to Obtain:** The strict requirements for claiming service credits make them a less reliable remedy.
*   **Data Protection Responsibilities:** Client bears significant responsibility for compliance, and vendor's role is limited.
*   **Dispute Resolution Favors Vendor:** The governing law and jurisdiction are set in the vendor's location, which can be disadvantageous for the client.

**This framework is a starting point and should be reviewed and customized by legal counsel for both parties to ensure it accurately reflects the agreed-upon terms and protects the interests of both Vendor and Client.**
