As a publicly listed company, it has grown into a global digital services provider with operations across 16+ countries spanning the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America, and Pakistan. In calendar year 2024, the company achieved a record revenue of PKR 67.5 billion ($242 million USD), up 26% year-on-year, driven by export services that account for 94% of its revenues.

Its core capabilities include Digital Transformation, Data & AI, Cloud & Infrastructure Services, and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO).
