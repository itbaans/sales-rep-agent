Subject: Urgent: Performance Degradation - Quantum Data Analytics (Project SL-5599-2025)

**From:** [IT Director] <[IT Director]@stc.com.sa>
**To:** Bilal Ahmed <bilal.ahmed@systems.ltd>

Dear Bilal,

We are experiencing significant performance degradation with the Quantum Data Analytics platform deployed for Project SL-5599-2025. Since yesterday evening (KSA time), data ingestion rates have dropped by approximately 40%, and query response times have increased by over 150%. This is severely impacting our operational reporting and decision-making processes.

Our internal monitoring indicates no unusual load on our infrastructure, suggesting the issue lies within the Quantum Data Analytics application itself or its underlying components managed by Systems Ltd.

We require an immediate investigation and resolution. Please confirm receipt and provide an estimated time for initial diagnosis.

Regards,

[IT Director]

Dear [IT Director],

Thank you for bringing this critical issue to our attention. We have received your report regarding the performance degradation of the Quantum Data Analytics platform for Project SL-5599-2025.

Our team in Karachi has been alerted and is currently initiating an urgent investigation. We understand the severity of this impact on your operations.

Our initial steps will involve:
1.  Reviewing recent system logs for any anomalies.
2.  Checking the health status of the Quantum Data Analytics cluster and its dependencies.
3.  Analyzing data ingestion queues and query execution plans.

We aim to provide an initial assessment and potential root cause within the next 2-3 hours (PKT). Please note that our team is operating during standard business hours in Pakistan (PKT). We will ensure continuous communication as we progress.

Subject: FW: Urgent: Performance Degradation - Quantum Data Analytics (Project SL-5599-2025) - Escalation Required

Hi Fatima,

Please see the urgent issue reported by STC regarding Project SL-5599-2025. Bilal's team is investigating, but given the client's critical nature and the impact, I believe this warrants your attention and potential involvement in coordinating with the client's management.

The client has highlighted a significant drop in data ingestion and query response times, impacting their operations. Bilal's team is working on it, but the time difference and the urgency of the request are becoming a factor.

Could you please review and advise on the best approach to manage client expectations and ensure timely resolution, especially considering our regional support coverage?

Thanks,

Ayesha,

Thank you for flagging this. I have reviewed the initial report from STC and Bilal's update.

Bilal, please continue with your technical investigation. I will reach out to [IT Director] and [Operations Manager] directly to acknowledge their concerns and provide a preliminary update from my end.

Regarding regional support coverage, our current SLA for Project SL-5599-2025 mandates a response time of 2 hours during business hours (09:00 - 18:00 KSA Time) and a best-effort response outside these hours. The current issue falls within business hours, so we are meeting the initial response requirement. However, the client's expectation is immediate resolution.

We need to be mindful of the time zone difference. While our Karachi team is working diligently, the client's operational hours are critical. We need to ensure that if the issue requires extended troubleshooting or a potential hotfix, we have a clear plan for continued support, potentially involving our Dubai-based resources if necessary, though they are currently engaged on another critical project.

**Action Items for Systems Ltd. Karachi Team (Bilal):**
1.  **Prioritize Root Cause Analysis:** Focus on identifying the exact cause of the performance degradation.
2.  **Develop a Mitigation Plan:** Outline immediate step
[Urgent: Response needed before EOD PKT]
s to restore performance, even if it's a temporary workaround.
3.  **Estimate Resolution Time:** Provide a realistic ETA for full resolution once the root cause is identified.
4.  **Document Findings:** Maintain detailed logs of all troubleshooting steps and findings.

**Budget Implications:**
If the root cause analysis reveals an issue requiring significant code changes, re-configuration beyond the scope of the initial implementation, or extensive performance tuning that exceeds the agreed-upon project scope, we will need to discuss potential additional work and associated costs with STC. This will be based on our contractual terms for out-of-scope support.

I will coordinate with Ayesha to schedule a brief call with STC management later today (KSA time) to discuss progress and next steps.

Fatima,

Update from the Karachi team: We have identified a potential bottleneck in the data processing pipeline related to a recent update in the underlying data lake connector. It appears that a specific data format introduced by STC's upstream systems is causing increased processing overhead within the Quantum Data Analytics engine, leading to the observed performance degradation.

We are currently testing a patch that optimizes the handling of this new data format. Our preliminary tests show a significant improvement, with ingestion rates returning to near-normal levels and query response times reducing by approximately 70%.

We anticipate having a stable hotfix ready for deployment within the next 2-3 hours (PKT). This would be around 7-8 PM PKT, which is 10-11 PM KSA time.

**Regarding Budget:**
The proposed solution involves a minor code adjustment to the connector module. This is a targeted fix for the specific data format issue. Based on our understanding of the contract for Project SL-5599-2025, such critical bug fixes within the implemented solution are covered under our standard support. However, if STC requires further extensive tuning or a more comprehensive re-architecture to accommodate future data format changes, that would be considered out-of-scope and would require a separate discussion and budget approval.

We will provide a detailed technical report and the hotfix for your review shortly.

Subject: Update & Proposed Next Steps: Quantum Data Analytics Performance (Project SL-5599-2025)

**From:** Fatima Khan <fatima.khan@systems.ltd>
**To:** [IT Director] <[IT Director]@stc.com.sa>

Dear [IT Director] and [Operations Manager],

Following up on your urgent report, I wanted to provide an update on our investigation into the performance degradation of the Quantum Data Analytics platform for Project SL-5599-2025.

Our technical team in Karachi has identified a potential root cause related to the handling of a new data format recently introduced by STC's upstream systems. This appears to be causing increased processing overhead.

The team is currently developing and testing a targeted hotfix to optimize the connector module for this specific data format. Preliminary results are promising, showing a significant improvement in ingestion rates and query response times.

We anticipate having a stable hotfix ready for deployment within the next 2-3 hours (PKT), which will be late evening KSA time. We will deploy this hotfix and closely monitor the system's performance.

**Regarding Budget:**
The proposed solution is a specific code adjustment to address the immediate performance issue. This is considered a critical bug fix within the scope of our ongoing support for Project SL-5599-2025. Should STC require further extensive performance tuning or architectural changes to accommodate future data format evolutions, we would be happy to discuss a separate proposal and budget for those services.

We understand the critical nature of this platform for your operations, and our team is working diligently to restore full functionality. We will keep you informed of the deployment status and post-deployment performance.

We are available for a brief call at your convenience to discuss this further.
