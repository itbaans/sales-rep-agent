### **Project Execution & Delivery (A Tale of Two Realities)**

**Timeline:**
*   **Planned Completion:** [Date Redacted]
*   **Actual Completion:** [Date Redacted] (On Time, Technically)

**Scope Management:**
*   **Initial Scope:** Clearly defined set of 3 core workflows.
*   **Evolved Scope:** Significant expansion of functionalities within the "basic customer service requests" category. This was a major driver of the challenges.
    *   *[Name Redacted] (Business Analyst):* "The client's understanding of 'basic' evolved significantly during the project. We received numerous requests for additional data validation and exception handling that were not part of the initial SOW. We tried to manage this through change requests, but the approval process wasâ€¦ protracted."
    *   *[Name Redacted] (Development Lead):* "Protracted is an understatement. We were constantly being asked to 'just add this one little thing' which would then cascade into needing new error handling, additional data lookups, and ultimately, more testing. It felt like we were building the plane while flying it."
    *   *[Name Redacted] (Client Stakeholder - Allied Bank):* "We were simply clarifying our requirements as we saw the automation take shape. It's natural for the client to refine their needs when they see the potential. Systems Ltd. should have been more proactive in anticipating these adjustments."

**Technical Implementation:**
*   **Automation Anywhere:** Core platform utilized. Bot development was generally efficient for the defined tasks.
*   **VB Scripting:** Used for data manipulation and system interaction. Some scripts were reportedly "less than optimal" and required significant debugging.
    *   *[Name Redacted] (QA Lead):* "The VB scripts were a recurring pain point. They were often written ad-hoc and lacked proper documentation or version control. This made regression testing a nightmare. We spent a disproportionate amount of time troubleshooting script errors that weren't directly related to the RPA logic."
    *   *[Name Redacted] (Developer):* "The VB scripting was necessary due to legacy system limitations. We were working with what we had. The tight timeline didn't allow for extensive refactoring of existing scripts."

**API Integration:**
*   Successfully integrated with [Specific System Name Redacted] for [Specific Functionality Redacted].
*   Challenges encountered with [Another System Name Redacted] due to undocumented API endpoints.

### **Metrics & KPIs (The Missing Pieces)**

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) - As Tracked:**

*   **Number of Automated Workflows:** 3 (Core) + [Number Redacted] (Add-ons)
*   **Bot Uptime:** [Percentage Redacted]% (Reported)
    *   *[Name Redacted] (Operations Lead):* "We're reporting 99.9% uptime, but this doesn't account for the frequent manual interventions required when bots encountered unexpected exceptions, which were often due to the expanded scope and less robust error handling on the added features."
*   **Manual Error Reduction:**
    *   *Internal User Feedback:* Generally positive, with users reporting fewer instances of data entry errors.
    *   *Quantitative Data:* **TBD** - No baseline metrics were established prior to automation, making direct comparison impossible. We relied on anecdotal evidence and user surveys.
*   **Processing Time Reduction:**
    *   *Account Opening:* Estimated [Percentage Redacted]% reduction.
    *   *Password Reset:* Estimated [Percentage Redacted]% reduction.
    *   *Customer Service Requests:* Highly variable due to the diverse nature of the added functionalities. **TBD** for spec

ific metrics.
*   **Return on Investment (ROI):** **TBD** - No formal ROI calculation was performed. The client has not publicly shared any financial projections or actual savings.

n:**
*   **Scope Creep:** The primary driver. Additional development hours were required to accommodate the expanded functionalities.
*   **Unforeseen Technical Challenges:** Debugging of VB scripts and integration issues with legacy systems consumed significant developer time.
*   **Extended Testing Cycles:** The increased complexity of the automated workflows necessitated longer and more thorough testing phases.
*   **Resource Reallocation:** Key personnel were pulled from other projects to address critical issues, leading to potential opportunity costs.

*   *[Name Redacted] (Finance Department):* "The budget overrun is concerning. While scope creep is a factor, the lack of detailed upfront planning and contingency for technical complexities contributed significantly. We need better forecasting models."
*   *[Name Redacted] (Project Manager):* "The client's evolving requirements, while not initially budgeted for, were critical to delivering a solution that met their perceived needs. We absorbed much of this through internal resource optimization."

### **Lessons Learned (The Optimistic Spin vs. The Harsh Reality)**

**Optimistic Takeaways:**

*   **Agile Delivery:** The team demonstrated remarkable agility in adapting to changing requirements and delivering a functional solution within a tight timeframe.
*   **Automation Potential:** The project successfully showcased the potential of RPA to streamline banking operations and reduce manual effort.
*   **Client Collaboration:** Despite challenges, a collaborative spirit was maintained with the Allied Bank team.

**Harsh Reality & Conflicting Accounts:**

*   **Scope Management is Paramount:** The project clearly illustrates the detrimental impact of uncontrolled scope creep. Without a robust change control process and clear client alignment on initial scope, projects are set up for failure.
    *   *[Name Redacted] (QA Lead):* "We learned that 'agile' doesn't mean 'no planning.' The lack of a well-defined baseline made our testing efforts reactive rather than proactive."
    *   *[Name Redacted] (Business Analyst):* "The client's expectation of 'flexibility' was interpreted as a carte blanche for scope expansion without proper impact assessment or formal change control."
*   **Baseline Metrics are Non-Negotiable:** The absence of baseline metrics renders any post-automation performance assessment speculative. Future projects *must* include detailed baseline data collection as a prerequisite.
    *   *[Name Redacted] (Development Lead):* "We can't prove we're faster if we don't know how slow we were to begin with. This makes it impossible to quantify the value delivered."
*   **Technical Debt Accumulation:** The reliance on ad-hoc scripting and lack of upfront technical due diligence created significant technical debt that will likely impact future maintenance and enhancements.
    *   *[Name Redacted] (Developer):* "We built a functional solution, but it's not necessarily a *maintainable* solution in the long run without significant refactoring."
*   **Blame Shifting:**
    *   *Development Team to BA/PM:* "The BAs and PM didn't adequately push back on scope changes or manage client expectations regarding the impact of these changes."
    *   *BA/PM to Development Team:* "The development team was too quick to agree to 'small' changes without fully assessing the downstream impact and communicating it effectively."
    *   *QA Team to Development Team:* "The quality of the VB scripts and the lack of proper documentation made our job exponentially harder."
    *   *Client to Systems Ltd.:* "Systems Ltd. should have been more proactive in anticipating our needs and managing the project more effectively."
