Subject: Urgent: Requirements Ambiguity on Provincial Citizen Services Portal (SL-5913-2020)

**From:** Aisha Khan (aisha.khan@sindh.gov.pk)
**To:** DeliveryTeam@TechSolutions.com
**Date:** 2023-10-26 10:00 PKT

Dear TechSolutions Delivery Team,

I am writing to express significant concerns regarding the ongoing development of the Provincial Citizen Services Portal (Project Code: SL-5913-2020). We have encountered substantial ambiguity in the project requirements, which is severely impacting our ability to provide clear direction and is leading to delays in critical module development.

Specifically, the project description, while outlining the portal's purpose, lacks the granular detail required for effective implementation. For instance, the "request permits" module has multiple interpretations regarding the types of permits, required documentation, and approval workflows. Similarly, the "file complaints" functionality is underspecified regarding categorization, escalation paths, and citizen notification mechanisms.

We have also noted a lack of usage metrics or user experience feedback being recorded for the modules that have been developed. This makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the current implementation and to identify areas for improvement.

We require immediate clarification and a structured approach to address these requirement gaps. Please advise on your plan to rectify this situation.

Sincerely,

Aisha Khan
Senior Project Manager
Sindh Provincial Department

Dear Ms. Khan,

Thank you for your email. We acknowledge your concerns regarding the Provincial Citizen Services Portal (SL-5913-2020).

Our team has been diligently working based on the documentation provided during the initial project kickoff. The requirements, as we understand them, were thoroughly discussed and signed off on. The current implementation reflects the agreed-upon scope.

Regarding the "request permits" and "file complaints" modules, our understanding aligns with the high-level descriptions provided. We believe the ambiguity you are experiencing may stem from evolving internal processes within your department that were not fully articulated during the initial discovery phase.

We are committed to ensuring client satisfaction and are happy to schedule a follow-up meeting to walk through the existing functionalities and address any specific points of confusion. Please let us know your availability.

Best regards,

The TechSolutions Delivery Team

Dear TechSolutions Delivery Team,

I am disappointed by your response. The issue is not with "evolving internal processes" but with the fundamental lack of detail in the initial project documentation. We provided a high-level overview, as is standard for such projects, expecting your team to engage in detailed requirement elicitation.

The "signed off" documentation you refer to is a broad outline, not a functional specification. We cannot proceed with development when the core functionalities are open to interpretation.

Furthermore, your statement about "usage metrics or user experience feedback being recorded" being a point of confusion is concerning. This was a critical aspect of ensuring a user-centric portal.

I am escalating this matter to our departmental leadership. We require a more proactive and collaborative approach to resolve these critical requirement gaps.

Sincerely,

Aisha Khan

Ambiguity on Provincial Citizen Services Portal (SL-5913-2020)

Dear Mr. Ahmed and Ms. Khan,

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We understand the importance of the Provincial Citizen Services Portal.

Our technical leads have reviewed the situation. While the initial documentation provided a framework, the development team has interpreted the requirements based on industry best practices for citizen service portals. The ambiguity you're experiencing might be a result of differing technical interpretations of the high-level objectives.

Our Business Analysts are currently reviewing the existing documentation and will propose a structured approach for requirement refinement. We will also be assigning a dedicated UX specialist to assess the current modules and provide recommendations for user experience enhancements.

We are committed to delivering a high-quality solution. We will provide a detailed action plan by EOD tomorrow, October 28th.

Sincerely,

**Date:** 2023-10-28 11:00 PKT

Dear [Director's Name],

We appreciate your acknowledgement of the issue. However, we are still awaiting the promised action plan. The "differing technical interpretations" is a euphemism for a lack of clear direction from your team.

Furthermore, the original email from our team mentioned the lack of usage metrics. Your response did not address this critical aspect. We need to understand how the current modules are performing and how citizens are interacting with them.

We also received an automated reply from your team yesterday stating that our previous email was being processed. This is not conducive to efficient communication.

Please provide the action plan and address the usage metrics issue immediately. We are operating on PKT, and your team's response times are causing significant delays.

Sincerely,

Aisha Khan

Dear Ms. Khan,

Please find attached the proposed action plan for requirement refinement and UX assessment. We have also included a preliminary report on the current module functionalities.

Regarding usage metrics, our development team has indicated that the current build does not have comprehensive analytics integrated. This was not a primary deliverable in the initial scope, but we are exploring options to incorporate basic tracking in the next sprint.

We understand your concerns about response times. Our team is working diligently to address all client requests.

Sincerely,

The TechSolutions Delivery Team

Dear TechSolutions Team,

The attachments you mentioned are not present in your email. This is unacceptable.

Furthermore, the statement that "basic tracking" for usage metrics will be incorporated in the "next sprint" is a vague commitment. We need a concrete timeline and a clear understanding of what "basic tracking" entails.

Our internal review has also uncovered that the "file complaints" module inadvertently captured sensitive citizen data (e.g., national ID numbers) without proper encryption or consent mechanisms. This is a serious breach of data privacy and requires immediate remediation. We have attached a redacted screenshot for your reference.

We are extremely dissatisfied with the progress and the lack of accountability. We require an urgent meeting with your senior management to discuss these critical issues and a clear roadmap for resolution.

Dear Ms. Khan,

Please accept our sincerest apologies for the missing attachments and the oversight regarding the data capture in the "file complaints" module. This is a critical issue that our security and development teams are addressing with the highest priority.

We have initiated an immediate investigation into the data capture mechanism and are implementing a patch to ensure data privacy compliance. We will provide a detailed report on the remediation steps by end of day tomorrow.

Regarding the action plan, it seems there was a miscommunication. The plan is being finalized and will be shared shortly. We are also scheduling a meeting with our senior leadership and your team for November 2nd at 10:00 AM PKT. Please confirm your availability.

We understand your frustration and are committed to rectifying these issues.

Dear [Director's Name],

We have received your email regarding the data breach and the proposed meeting. While we appreciate the acknowledgement, the "patch" for data privacy is a reactive measure. The fundamental issue of inadequate requirement definition has led to this critical vulnerability.

We are still awaiting the finalized action plan and a clear strategy for addressing the requirement ambiguity and the lack of usage metrics. The proposed meeting is a step in the right direction, but we need concrete deliverables and a commitment to a revised project timeline.

The current state of the project is highly unsatisfactory, and the ongoing delays and critical issues are impacting our department's ability to serve the citizens of Sindh effectively. We expect a comprehensive resolution, not just superficial fixes.

Aisha Khan
