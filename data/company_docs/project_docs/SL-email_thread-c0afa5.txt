Subject: URGENT: Critical Defects in Hami AI-Assistant Platform - Project SL-5902-2024

**From:** Sarah Chen (sarah.chen@bostonhealthai.com)
**To:** DeliveryTeam@hamiai.com
**Date:** 2024-03-15 10:30 AM (Boston Time)

Dear Hami Delivery Team,

We are writing to express our significant concern regarding several critical technical defects identified in the initial build of the Hami AI-Assistant Platform, deployed on March 14th. While the initial user reception has been positive, these bugs are severely impacting the core functionality and user experience.

Specifically, we have encountered the following issues:

1.  **Chat-based Recommendation Engine Inaccuracy:** The AI is frequently providing irrelevant or incorrect medical recommendations based on user-inputted symptoms. This is a major liability for a healthcare application.
2.  **Symptom Triage Malfunction:** The triage system is not accurately categorizing the severity of symptoms, leading to potentially dangerous misdirection of patients.
3.  **Physician Availability Lag:** The physician availability suggestions are consistently outdated, showing physicians as available when they are not, or vice-versa.

We require immediate attention to these issues. Please provide a detailed action plan and timeline for resolution by EOD today. We have attached a comprehensive bug report with screenshots and reproduction steps.

Sincerely,

Sarah Chen
Senior Product Manager
Boston Health AI

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for your email. We acknowledge receipt of your concerns regarding the Hami AI-Assistant Platform.

Our team has reviewed the initial feedback. It's important to note that this is an early build, and some minor discrepancies are to be expected during the initial rollout phase. The AI recommendation engine is designed to learn and improve over time with more data.

Regarding the symptom triage and physician availability, these are complex integrations. We believe the reported issues might be related to data synchronization or caching on the client-side. We are currently investigating potential optimizations.

We will provide an update on our findings within 48 hours. Please ensure all relevant logs and user data are being captured on your end to aid our investigation.

Best regards,

Hami Delivery Team

This is unacceptable. "Minor discrepancies" and "client-side caching" are not acceptable explanations for critical functional failures in a healthcare application. The recommendation engine is not "learning," it's providing dangerous advice. The triage system is actively misdirecting patients.

We have not received the promised bug report attachment. Please resend it immediately.

We need a concrete plan, not vague assurances. This requires immediate escalation to your management. Please forward this to your Project Lead and Head of Engineering.

Dear Sarah,

I am Amir Khan, the Project Lead for the Hami platform. I have been looped into this conversation.

I understand your frustration. However, our engineering team has conducted an initial assessment, and there appears to be a divergence in technical interpretation. Our backend AI models are performing within expected parameters based on the training data provided. The perceived inaccuracies might stem from the way user input is being processed or interpreted by the front-end interface.

Furthermore, the physician availability module relies on real-time data feeds from your integrated EMR systems. Any latency or data formatting inconsistencies from your end could manifest as outdated information. We recommend a joint diagnostic session to pinpoint the root cause.

We are committed to a collaborative resolution.

Best regards,

Amir Khan
Project Lead

Amir,

With all due respect, this sounds like blame-shifting. Our front-end processing is standard and has been thoroughly tested. The issues are clearly with the core AI logic and the data integration p

Team,

I'm forwarding this thread from Sarah at Boston Health AI. It seems there are some critical issues with the Hami platform.

[Original message content from Sarah Chen, dated 2024-03-16 02:00 PM (Boston Time)]

Sarah,

I've reviewed the situation. Our engineering team is working diligently to address the reported defects. We are prioritizing the AI recommendation engine and symptom triage.

Regarding the physician availability, our analysis indicates that the data ingestion pipeline from your EMR partners might be experiencing intermittent connectivity issues, leading to data staleness. We've also identified a potential vulnerability in the handling of sensitive patient data (PHI) within the chat logs, which we are addressing with immediate effect. Please ensure all internal PHI handling protocols are strictly adhered to on your end as well.

We are targeting a patch release by end of next week. We will provide a more detailed technical breakdown by tomorrow.

Regards,

David Lee
Head of Engineering

David,

Thank you for finally engaging. However, your email is concerning for several reasons:

1.  **"Potential vulnerability in the handling of sensitive patient data (PHI)"**: This is a critical security lapse that was not previously disclosed. What exactly is this vulnerability, and what is the scope of the exposure? This needs immediate and transparent communication.
2.  **"Intermittent connectivity issues from your EMR partners"**: This is a baseless accusation. Our EMR integrations are robust and have been functioning flawlessly with other applications. This is a clear attempt to deflect responsibility.
3.  **"Patch release by end of next week"**: This is still a vague commitment. We need a specific date and a clear list of what will be fixed.

We are still missing the bug report attachment. This is becoming a pattern of unprofessionalism.

We are requesting an emergency call with you, Amir, and the lead engineers from both sides to discuss these issues and a concrete resolution plan.
