Subject: Urgent: Critical Issues with OR Scheduling System Implementation - Project SL-8895-2023

**From:** Dr. Aisha Khan (aisha.khan@akuh.org)
**To:** Project Management Office (pm.office@techsolutions.com)

Dear Project Management Office,

I am writing to express significant concerns regarding the ongoing implementation of the tablet-based Operating Room scheduling and checklist system (Project SL-8895-2023). While we appreciate the efforts made, several critical issues are impacting our operational efficiency and require immediate attention.

Specifically, we are experiencing:

1.  **Integration Gaps:** The system is not seamlessly integrating with our existing legacy HIS. This is causing data discrepancies and manual workarounds, negating the intended benefits of the new system.
2.  **Timeline Challenges:** The projected go-live date is rapidly approaching, and the current state of development and testing suggests we will not meet this deadline without significant compromises.
3.  **User Adoption Problems:** Despite the training sessions, a substantial portion of our OR staff, particularly nurses and senior surgeons, are hesitant to fully adopt the new system. Feedback indicates usability concerns and a lack of confidence in data accuracy due to the integration issues.
4.  **Legacy System Constraints:** We understand there are limitations with our legacy systems, but the current solution appears to be exacerbating these rather than mitigating them.

We require a comprehensive plan of action to address these points urgently. Please provide an updated project status and a clear roadmap for resolution.

Sincerely,

Dr. Aisha Khan
Head of Operations, Surgical Services
Aga Khan University Hospital

Dear Dr. Khan,

Thank you for your email. We acknowledge your concerns regarding Project SL-8895-2023.

Our delivery team has been diligently working on the OR scheduling system. Regarding the integration gaps, we have identified some areas where the legacy system's architecture presents challenges, which are being addressed through our standard integration protocols. We are confident that these are manageable.

The timeline is being actively monitored, and we are implementing agile methodologies to ensure timely delivery. User adoption is a key focus, and we are planning additional targeted training sessions based on initial feedback.

We will be sharing a detailed status report by end of day tomorrow, October 27th, which will outline our mitigation strategies.

Best regards,

The Project Management Office
TechSolutions Inc.

Dear PMO,

I am escalating this matter. The response from the PMO is insufficient and does not address the severity of the issues raised by Dr. Khan. The "standard integration protocols" are clearly not working, and the "manageable" challenges are causing significant operational disruptions.

We have not received the promised detailed status report by end of day yesterday. This lack of transparency and proactive problem-solving is unacceptable.

I need an immediate escalation to your senior management. We need a dedicated technical lead to engage directly with our IT department to resolve these integration gaps.

Regards,

Tariq Hassan

Tariq,

I agree with your assessment. The PMO's response is a classic case of "managing expectations" rather than "solving problems."

From my team's perspective, the core issue lies with the **backend data synchronization module**. Our nurses are reporting that the patient data pulled from the legacy HIS into the new system is often incomplete or outdated. This is directly impacting their ability to accurately complete checklists and manage patient flow.

I suspect the development team might have prioritized the UI/UX over robust data integration, which is a critical flaw given the system's purpose.

Dear Mr. Hassan and Ms. Ali,

We understand your concerns and apologize for the delay in the status report. It is currently being finalized and will be sent shortly.

To clarify, the integration challenges are not solely a backend issue. Our technical assessment indicates that the **API endpoints provided by AKUH's legacy HIS are not consistently returning data in the expected format**, leading to parsing errors on our end. This is a collaborative issue requiring input

from both teams.

We have attached a preliminary technical assessment document for your review.

Regarding user adoption, the feedback from the training sessions indicates a need for more hands-on practice with specific scenarios. We are proposing a series of focused workshops.

We are committed to a successful project outcome.

Best regards,

The Project Management Office

This is becoming increasingly frustrating.

1.  **The attachment is missing.** Please resend it immediately.
2.  **Blame shifting is not productive.** Our IT department has confirmed the stability and expected output of our HIS APIs. The issue lies with how your system is consuming and processing this data. We provided detailed API documentation during the discovery phase.
3.  **"Focused workshops" are not a solution for fundamental integration gaps.** We need a technical resolution, not more training on a flawed system.
4.  **The timeline is still a major concern.** We are now days away from the original go-live, and the core issues remain unresolved.

I am requesting an urgent meeting with your Head of Delivery and our respective senior management to find a path forward.

Dear Mr. Hassan,

Please accept our apologies for the missing attachment. It has been re-attached below.

We understand your frustration. Our delivery team is working diligently to address all identified issues. We have scheduled a call with your IT team for Monday, October 30th, at 2:00 PM PKT, to collaboratively review the API interaction logs and pinpoint the exact root cause.

In parallel, we are proposing a phased rollout approach, focusing on a pilot group of users first, to mitigate immediate operational impact and gather further feedback for iterative improvements. This will allow us to refine the integration and user experience before a full-scale deployment.

We are committed to a successful partnership.

Best regards,

This is an update following the meeting scheduled for today.

The meeting was unproductive. The TechSolutions technical lead was unable to provide concrete solutions for the integration gaps. They reiterated the API compatibility concerns, which our IT team has thoroughly investigated and found to be unfounded. The proposed "phased rollout" is a delay tactic, not a solution.

Furthermore, during the discussion, the TechSolutions representative accidentally shared a document containing sensitive patient data from another 
[Attachment: missing_spec.docx NOT FOUND]
project (Project ID: XYZ-7890, Patient MRN: 123456789) in the chat. This is a serious breach of confidentiality and requires immediate investigation and reporting.

The user adoption issues are directly linked to the system's instability and data inaccuracies. Our nurses are refusing to use the system for critical tasks due to these fundamental flaws.

We are now significantly behind schedule, and the proposed resolutions are vague and lack commitment. The overall project health is critical.

Dear Dr. Khan,

We acknowledge your feedback regarding the meeting on October 30th. We are reviewing the technical discussions internally to ensure alignment.

Regarding the accidental sharing of sensitive information, we sincerely apologize for this oversight. This was an unintentional error, and we are conducting a thorough internal review to prevent recurrence and ensure compliance with all data privacy regulations. We will provide a formal report on this incident shortly.

Our commitment to resolving the integration gaps remains. We are re-allocating additional senior development resources to focus on the data synchronization module. We will provide a revised action plan by end of day tomorrow, November 1st, outlining specific deliverables and timelines for the integration fixes.

We understand the urgency and are working to bring this project to a successful conclusion.

This is the final straw.

The "revised action plan" is a rehash of previous vague commitments. It offers no concrete solutions, no clear timelines for actual resolution, and no accountability. The "additional senior development resources" are still struggling to understand the fundamental data flow.

The user adoption issues are now critical. Our ORs are experiencing significant delays and errors due to the unreliability of this system. Nurses are reverting to paper-based checklists, completely undermining the project's purpose.

The accidental sharing of patient data is still being investigated, and we have received no formal report.

We are now in a situation where the project is failing to deliver on its core objectives, the timeline is completely blown, and the client's trust has been severely eroded.

We require an immediate escalation to your CEO. We need a definitive plan with guaranteed deliverables and a clear statement of accountability from TechSolutions. If this cannot be provided, we will be forced to consider alternative solutions and potentially seek damages for the operational impact.
