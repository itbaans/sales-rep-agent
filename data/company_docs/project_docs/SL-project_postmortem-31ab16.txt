### **Budgetary Considerations (A Matter of Interpretation)**

**Original Budget:** [REDACTED - For Internal Review Only]

**Final Spend:** [REDACTED - Significant Variance Noted]

**Justification for Overrun:**

*   **Unforeseen Integration Complexity:** The depth of integration required with AKUH's existing, highly customized legacy systems proved more resource-intensive than initially scoped. This necessitated additional development cycles and specialized expertise.
*   **Scope Creep (Client-Initiated):** Several requests for enhanced functionalities and reporting capabilities were incorporated post-initial sign-off, requiring re-scoping and additional development effort. (See Appendix A: Change Request Log - **Statu
[ACTION ITEM: Never assigned or completed]
s: Incomplete, some CRs not formally closed**)
*   **Extended Testing & Stabilization:** Due to the integration challenges and user adoption curve, extended testing and post-deployment support were required, incurring additional personnel costs.

**Finance Department Comment:** "The budget variance is substantial. While some factors were external, a more robust risk assessment during the planning phase could have mitigated some of these costs."

### **Key Issues & Challenges (Where the Wheels Came Off)**

#### **1. Integration Gaps (The Elephant in the Room)**

**Assessment:** The project encountered significant challenges in seamlessly integrating the new OR Management System with AKUH's existing legacy systems, particularly the HIS. This resulted in data silos and manual workarounds, undermining the intended end-to-end workflow automation.

**Conflicting Accounts:**

*   **Systems Ltd. Development Lead:** "The legacy system's architecture was poorly documented and lacked modern APIs. We had to reverse-engineer significant portions, which was not accounted for in the original SOW. The client's IT team was not fully available for timely technical consultations."
*   **AKUH IT Representative:** "Systems Ltd. did not adequately assess the complexity of our existing infrastructure during the discovery phase. Their proposed integration strategy was overly simplistic and failed to account for critical data dependencies. We provided all available documentation."
*   **Systems Ltd. Business Analyst:** "We identified potential integration risks early on, but the client prioritized speed to market for core functionalities. The decision was made to defer full integration to a later phase, which has now become a persistent issue."

#### **2. Timeline Challenges (The Never-Ending Story)**

**Assessment:** The project experienced significant delays, impacting the planned deployment schedule and client expec

tations.

**Contradictory Assessments:**

*   **Systems Ltd. Project Manager:** "The timeline was ambitious from the outset, given the scope and the client's internal processes. We managed to deliver core functionalities despite unforeseen technical hurdles and resource constraints on both sides."
*   **AKUH Project Sponsor:** "The delays were unacceptable. We had operational teams ready to adopt the new system, and the constant rescheduling caused disruption and frustration. The communication regarding delays was often reactive rather than proactive."

#### **3. User Adoption Problems (The Human Element)**

**Assessment:** While user acceptance training was delivered, full and consistent adoption of the new system by OR staff has not been confirmed. Resistance to change, perceived complexity, and reliance on familiar manual processes are contributing factors.

**Blame-Shifting:**

*   **Systems Ltd. Training Lead:** "The training materials were comprehensive, and the sessions were well-received. However, the client's management did not adequately enforce the use of the new system post-training, allowing staff to revert to old habits."
*   **AKUH Nursing Supervisor:** "The tablets were often slow, and the interface was not as intuitive as we expected, especially for experienced nurses who are already managing multiple critical tasks. The training was rushed, and we didn't have enough time to practice in a real-world scenario before deployment."
*   **Systems Ltd. UI/UX Designer:** "We received feedback during UAT that certain workflows could be simplified. However, due to timeline pressures, these refinements were deprioritized. The client also requested several UI changes late in the development cycle that impacted usability testing."

#### **4. Legacy System Constraints (The Ghost in the Machine)**

**Assessment:** The project's reliance on and inte
[NOTE: Actual benefits differ from promised efficiency, data accuracy]
raction with AKUH's existing legacy systems presented significant technical limitations and data integrity concerns.

**Vague Justifications:**

*   **Systems Ltd. Technical Architect:** "The legacy system's data model was not conducive to real-time updates required by our system. This necessitated complex data transformation processes, which introduced latency and potential data discrepancies. We had to build workarounds for functionalities that should have been standard."
*   **AKUH IT Department:** "Our legacy system is a robust and proven platform. The new system should have been designed to accommodate its architecture, not the other way around. The issues stem from the new system's design choices."

*   **Strong Client Collaboration is Crucial:** Open communication and partnership with AKUH were instrumental in navigating complexities.
*   **Continuous Improvement Mindset:** The project has provided valuable insights for future healthcare IT implementations.

**Harsh Reality:**

*   **Underestimating Legacy Systems:** We consistently underestimated the impact of legacy system integration on timelines and budget.
*   **Inadequate Risk Assessment:** Critical risks related to integration and user adoption were not sufficiently identified or mitigated during the planning phase.
*   **Scope Management Failures:** The inability to effectively manage scope creep led to significant delays and budget overruns.
*   **User Adoption Requires More Than Training:** Technical solutions alone are insufficient; a robust change management strategy is essential.
