**Meeting Objective:** Address critical issues impacting the Provincial Citizen Services Portal project, specifically requirements ambiguity, and determine a path forward.

---

**Discussion Points & Decisions:**

*   **Opening & Late Arrivals:** Sarah opened the meeting, noting Mr. Khan and Ms. Ali's late arrival. Mr. Khan apologized, citing an urgent departmental matter.
*   **Project Status Overview (Sarah):**
    *   Still facing significant challenges with requirements.
    *   The initial scope document is… well, it’s a starting point.
    *   We’ve identified several modules: permit applications, complaint filing, status tracking. But the specifics are… fuzzy.
    *   No real usage metrics from the pilot phase, which is concerning.
    *   UX feedback is largely unrecorded, or at least not in a consolidated format we can easily access.
*   **Requirements Ambiguity Deep Dive (John & David):**
[Audio cut out - missed 2 minutes]

    *   **John:** The core issue is that the client's understanding of "permit" varies across departments. We need to nail down the exact types of permits, the workflow for each, and the required documentation. The current spec just says "permit application."
    *   **David:** From a technical standpoint, this is a nightmare. We built the database schema based on the initial understanding, but if the requirements shift significantly, we'll have to refactor a lot. The API endpoints for permit submission… they’re not robust enough for the potential variations.
    *   **Sarah:** David, didn't we have a separate document outlining the permit types?
    *   **David:** We had a draft, but it was never finalized. And the data model we're using… it doesn't quite align with what John's team is trying to map out now. It's a bit of technical debt we've been carrying.
    *   **John:** But the initial requirements gathering *did* include a breakdown of permit categories. I thought that was signed off?
    *   **Maria:** The user flows we designed were based on those categories, but without clear data fields and validation rules, they're just theoretical. We need to know the exact data points for each permit type.
    *   **Mr. Khan:** (Interjecting) We provided the initial requirements. The problem is not with us, it's with the interpretation. We need the portal to be functional.
    *   **Ms. Ali:** Mr. Khan, the ambiguity is making it difficult for the development team to build a stable product. We need clarity on the data fields for each permit type. For example, for a construction permit, what are the specific dimensions, materials, and approval stages?
    *   **John:** Exactly. And the complaint filing module – what are the categories of complaints? Is it just general feedback, or specific service-related issues? The current system can’t handle granular categorization.
    *   **David:** The backend logic for complaint routing is tied to a very basic category system. If we need to route complaints to specific departmental units, we need that defined.
    *   **Sarah:** So, to clarify, the core problem is the lack of detailed data requirements for each service.
    *   **Mr. Khan:** We need the portal to be live. We can refin

e the details later.
    *   **Robert:** (Clears throat) Speaking of "later," we need to be mindful of the budget. Any significant rework or scope expansion will impact the allocated funds. We're already… stretched.
    *   **Sarah:** Robert, we understand. That's why we need to get this right *now* to avoid costly rework down the line.
*   **UX Feedback & Usability (Maria):**
    *   The user journey for permit applications is currently too complex. Citizens are getting lost.
    *   We need to conduct more user testing, but we don't have a stable build to test with.
    *   The complaint submission form is too generic. Users don't know what inf
[Side discussion about unrelated budget issues]
ormation is most helpful.
    *   **Ms. Ali:** The current design for the complaint tracking page is confusing. Users can't easily see the status updates.
    *   **Maria:** We can improve that, but we need the backend data structure to support clear status updates. Right now, it's just a generic "in progress" or "resolved."
    *   **Mr. Khan:** The design looks fine. It's the functionality that's the issue.
*   **Technical Debt & Architecture (David):**
    *   The current architecture is not scalable for the potential volume of users.
    *   We used a monolithic approach for the initial build, which makes it harder to update individual modules.
    *   The database performance is degrading with the limited data we *do* have.
    *   **Sarah:** David, what are the immediate risks of this technical debt?
    *   **David:** If we try to add more complex features without addressing the underlying architecture, we'll see significant performance issues and increased bug rates. It's a ticking time bomb.
    *   **John:** So, the current system is not built to handle the variations we're discussing?
    *   **David:** Not without significant refactoring.
*   **Budget Concerns (Robert):**
    *   We've already approved X amount for Phase 1. Any deviation needs formal approval.
    *   The current trajectory suggests we might exceed the budget if we have to do extensive rework.
    *   **Sarah:** We need to understand the cost implications of clarifying these requirements and potentially refactoring.
    *   **Robert:** We need a clear proposal with estimated costs before any decisions are made.
*   **Off-Topic Discussion:** Mr. Khan spent several minutes discussing the upcoming provincial sports festival and its potential impact on citizen engagement with online services. Sarah gently steered the conversation back.
[Side discussion about unrelated budget issues]

*   **Decisions & Walkbacks:**
    *   **Initial Decision:** Proceed with the current requirements and address ambiguities in later phases. (Proposed by Mr. Khan)
    *   **Discussion:** This was met with strong resistance from the development and UX teams due to the technical debt and usability concerns.
    *   **Revised Decision:** We will hold a dedicated requirements clarification workshop with the client to define the specific data fields and workflows for the core modules (permit applications, complaint filing).
    *   **Walkback:** Mr. Khan expressed concern about the time commitment for the workshop. "Can't we just get a list of what you need?"
    *   **Sarah:** A list won't suffice, Mr. Khan. We need to discuss and validate the details.
*   **Action Items (Unassigned/Vague):**
    *   John to compile a list of all known permit types and complaint categories.
    *   David to provide an estimate for refactoring the database schema.
    *   Maria to prepare a revised user journey map based on hypothetical clarified requirements.
    *   Sarah to schedule the requirements clarification workshop.
    *   **FOLLOW U
[Attendee left early for another meeting]
P:** What are the specific data fields required for each permit type? (This was asked multiple times, no concrete answer)
    *   **FOLLOW UP:** What are the acceptable performance metrics for the portal? (No baseline defined)
    *   **FOLLOW UP:** When can we expect the finalized requirements document? (Client response: "As soon as possible.")
*   **[CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL]** Discussion regarding the potential impact of a recent departmental restructuring on the project's priority and resource allocation. This was a sensitive topic, and details were kept brief.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Schedule requirements clarification workshop.
    *   Review technical debt implications.
    *   Re-evaluate project timeline and budget based on workshop outcomes.
    *   **No owners or deadlines assigned for these steps.**
