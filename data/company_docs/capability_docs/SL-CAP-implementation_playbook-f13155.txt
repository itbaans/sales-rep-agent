### 2. Setup Guide

This section provides a step-by-step guide for setting up a new Proof-of-Concept (POC) environment within Studio 77.

**2.1. Network Connectivity:**

1.  **Connect to Studio 77 Network:**
    *   For wired connections, plug into any available port on the rack-mounted switches. Ensure you are on VLAN 77. If you get an IP outside the `192.168.77.0/24` range, you're likely on the wrong VLAN.
    *   For wireless, connect to `SystemsLab_IoT_Secure`. The password is `Ask_Sarah_for_the_current_password`.
2.  **Firewall Rules:**
    *   **Crucial:** If you need to access external services (e.g., AWS IoT Core), you *must* submit a firewall request to the IT department. Include the source IP of your device and the destination IP/port.
    *   **Gotcha:** The default firewall rules are very restrictive. Expect delays if your request is not clearly documented.

**2.2. IoT Device Onboarding:**

1.  **Provisioning:**
    *   For Raspberry Pi devices, flash the latest `SystemsLab_Raspbian_IoT_v2.1.img` image. This image includes pre-configured agents for AWS IoT Core.
    *   For ESP32/Arduino devices, you'll need to manually configure the Wi-Fi credentials and the AWS IoT endpoint.
2.  **AWS IoT Core Registration:**
    *   Create a new "Thing" in AWS IoT Core.
    *   Download the device certificate, private key, and root CA certificate.
    *   **Hardcoded Value:** The AWS IoT endpoint for our lab is `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.
    *   Copy these certificates to your device. For Raspberry Pi, place them in `/etc/aws-iot/certs/`.
3.  **Telemetry Configuration:**
    *   Edit the `aws-iot-device-sdk-python/samples/pubsub/pubsub.py` script.
    *   **Hardcoded Value:** Change the `topic` variable to `systems/lab/telemetry/<your_device_id>`.
    *   **Incomplete Step:** The script needs to be modified to read sensor data. Refer to the `Ask_David_for_sensor_integration_examples` documentation.

**2.3. Blockchain Node Setup:**

1.  **Hyperledger Fabric:**
    *   Clone the `fabric-samples` repository from our internal Git server.
    *   Navigate to the `test-network` directory.
    *   Run `./network.sh up createChannel -c mychannel -i 2.5`.
    *   **Environment-Specific Gotcha:** This command assumes you have Docker and Docker Compose installed and configured correctly. If you encounter issues, try restarting Docker.
2.  **Azure Blockchain Service (Legacy):**
    *   **Deprecated Approach:** While Azure Blockchain Service is deprecated, some older POCs still rely on it.
    *   Follow the old Azure documentation to provision a new blockchain consortium.
    *   **Ask_Maria_for_the_deprecated_Azure_credentials**.

**2.4. AI/ML Environment:**

1.  **Jupyter Notebooks:**
    *   Launch a Jupyter Notebook server on your workstation.
    *   **Hardcoded Value:** Use the command `jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888`.
    *   Access it via `http://<your_workstation_ip>:8888`.
2.  **Model Training:**
    *   Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn).
    *   **Incomplete Step:** The specific dataset paths and preprocessing steps will vary per POC. Consult the individual POC documentation.

### 3. Configuration Reference

This section provides examples of common configuration parameters.

**3.1. AWS IoT Core Device Configuration:**

*   **`endpoint`**: `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` (Hardcoded)
*   **`client_id`**: `<unique_device_identifier>`
*   **`cert_file`**: `/etc/aws-iot/certs/device.pem.crt`
*   **`key_file`**: `/etc/
**TODO: Add diagram here**
aws-iot/certs/private.pem.key`
*   **`root_ca_file`**: `/etc/aws-iot/certs/AmazonRootCA1.pem`

**3.2. Hyperledger Fabric Peer Configuration (Example `core.yaml` snippet):**

```yaml
peer:
  id: peer0.org1.example.com
  address: localhost:7051
  listenAddress: 0.0.0.0:7051
  chaincode:
    installToList:
      - cc_name: mycc
        version: 1.0
        path: github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02
```

**3.3. IPFS Configuration:**

*   **`Addresses.API`**: `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001`
*   **`Addresses.Gateway`**: `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8080`
*   **`Bootstrap`**: `/ip4/192.168.77.10/tcp/4001/ipfs/Qm...` (This is a placeholder, actual bootstrap nodes vary)

### 4. Troubleshooting

This section covers common issues encountered during POC development.

1.  **Device Not Connecting to AWS IoT Core:**
    *   **First Option:** Contact AWS Support.
    *   **Second Option:** Double-check your certificates and endpoint. Ensure the device is on VLAN 77 and has internet access.
    *   **Veteran Secret:** Sometimes, the AWS IoT endpoint can be flaky. Try restarting the device and the AWS IoT Core SDK process.
2.  **Blockchain Node Not Starting:**
    *   Check Docker logs: `docker logs <container_name>`.
    *   **First Option:** Contact the R&D team lead.
    *   **
[WARNING: Deprecated approach - remove before production use]
Second Option:** Ensure your `docker-compose.yaml` file is correctly configured for your environment.
    *   **Incomplete Step:** The error messages can be cryptic. Look for specific port conflicts or missing configuration files.
3.  **Data Not Appearing in PostgreSQL:**
    *   Verify your database connection string.
    *   Check if the application writing to the database is running.
    *   **Ask_John_for_database_connection_details**.
4.  **IPFS Upload/Download Failures:**
    *   Ensure your IPFS daemon is running.
    *   Check your network connectivity to other IPFS peers.
    *   **Veteran Secret:** If you're having trouble connecting to the bootstrap node, try manually adding a known good peer to your `ipfs config Addresses.Bootstrap` array.

### 5. Best Practices

This section outlines recommended practices for R&D within Studio 77.

*   **Version Control Everything:** Use Git for all code, configurations, and even documentation.
*   **Containerize Your Applications:** Docker is your friend. It helps with reproducibility.
*   **Modularize Your Code:** Break down complex POCs into smaller, manageable components.
*   **Document Your Experiments:** Even if it's just a README file, document what you did, why, and any assumptions.
*   **Test Incrementally:** Don't try to build the entire POC at once. Test each component as you build it.

**Contradictions with Actual Implementations:**

*   While modularization is encouraged, many POCs end up with monolithic codebases due to tight deadlines.
*   Documentation is often an afterthought, leading to the reliance on "Ask [Expert Name]" for critical information.
*   The "test incrementally" advice is frequently ignored, leading to large integration issues late in the development cycle.
*   Security considerations are often addressed *after* a POC is functional, leading to vulnerabilities.

---

**Security Considerations (Afterthought):**

*   **Access Control:** Studio 77 access is restricted. 
[PERFORMANCE: Known bottlenecks in data processing]
Ensure you have the necessary badges.
*   **Data Sensitivity:** Be mindful of the data you are handling in your POCs. Do not store sensitive customer data without explicit approval and proper security measures.
*   **Network Segmentation:** VLAN 77 is intended to isolate lab traffic. Do not bridge it to other internal networks without authorization.
*   **Credential Management:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials. Use environment variables or secure secret management tools where possible (though this is not always followed in practice).

---

**Performance Tuning "Secrets" (Known Only to Veterans):**

*   **IoT Telemetry Buffering:** For high-volume telemetry, implement a local buffer on the IoT device before sending to AWS IoT Core. This reduces network calls and improves resilience.
*   **Blockchain Transaction Batching:** When interacting with Hyperledger Fabric, batch multiple transactions into a single transaction submission to reduce overhead.
*   **AI Model Optimization:** For edge deployments, consider model quantization and pruning techniques to reduce model size and inference time.
*   **Database Indexing:** Ensure your PostgreSQL database has appropriate indexes for frequently queried fields.
