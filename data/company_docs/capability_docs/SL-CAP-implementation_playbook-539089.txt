## Systems Ltd. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Capability - Technical Implementation Playbook

**Version:** 1.2
**Date:** 2023-10-27

### 1. Architecture Overview

This document outlines the technical implementation of Systems Ltd.'s Robotic Process Automation (RPA) capability, primarily leveraging Automation Anywhere (AA) to automate back-office workflows within the Banking and BPO sectors. Our implementations have historically focused on specific client needs, leading to a pragmatic, albeit sometimes narrowly scoped, approach.

**Core Components:**

*   **Automation Anywhere Control Room:** The central mana

gement console for bot deployment, scheduling, monitoring, and credential management.
    *   *Note: Specific version details are client-dependent. Refer to individual project documentation.*
*   **Automation Anywhere Bot Runners:** The agents installed on virtual machines

 (VMs) or physical machines that execute the automated processes.
    *   *Consideration: Dedicated VMs are preferred for stability, but shared environments have been used in some BPO scenarios.*
*   **Client Application Servers:** The target systems where bots interact (e.g., core banking systems, CRM, ERP).
    *   *Dependency: Access and permissions are critical. This is often a major bottleneck.*
*   **Credential Vault:** Secure storage for application credentials used by bots.
    *   *Implementation Detail: Often integrated with Active Directory or a dedicated vault solution. Specific integration methods vary.*

**Missing Components/Diagrams:**

*   Detailed network topology diagrams showing bot runner to application server communication.
*   Diagrams illustrating the interaction between Control Room, Bot Runners, and the Credential Vault.
*   Flowcharts for common bot interactions with specific client applications.

### 2. Setup Guide

This section provides a high-level guide to setting up the RPA environment. **Environment-specific configurations are critical and will deviate significantly.**

**2.1. Control Room Installation (On-Premise/Cloud)**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Windows Server (e.g., Windows Server 2016 or later).
    *   SQL Server (e.g., SQL Server 2017 or later).
    *   Sufficient RAM and CPU resources.
    *   *Gotcha (Allied Bank Specific):* Ensure the server is provisioned within the existing Allied Bank VMWare cluster, adhering to their specific VM sizing guidelines. Do NOT use a standard template.
2.  **Installation Steps:**
    *   Download the Automation Anywhere installer.
    *   Run the installer and follow the prompts.
    *   Configure database connection.
    *   *Incomplete Step:* Configure web server settings. Refer to the AA documentation for detailed web server configuration.
    *   *Ask Rajesh:* For specific IIS configurations and SSL certificate binding, Rajesh is the go-to expert.

**2.2. Bot Runner Installation**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Windows OS (e.g., Windows 10, Windows Server 2019).
    *   Automation Anywhere Bot Runner client installed.
    *   Network connectivity to the Control Room.
    *   *Gotcha (BPO Client X):* For BPO Client X, Bot Runners were installed on shared desktop VMs. This led to performance issues and required frequent restarts. If this is unavoidable, ensure users are trained to log out properly.
2.  **Installation Steps:**
    *   Install the Bot Runner client on the target machine.
    *   Connect the Bot Runner to the Control Room using the provided URL and credentials.
    *   *Incomplete Step:* Configure proxy settings if applicable.
    *   *Ask Priya:* Priya has the master list of proxy configurations for various client networks.

**2.3. Credential Vault Integration**

1.  **Options:**
    *   **Automation Anywhere Built-in Vault:** Simple to configure, but may not meet stringent security requirements.
    *   **Active Directory Integration:** Preferred for enterprise environments.
    *   **Third-Party Vault (e.g., CyberArk):** Requires custom integration.
        *   *Deprecated Approach:* Early implementations sometimes used plain text credential files. **DO NOT USE THIS.**
2.  **Configuration:**
    *   Refer to the Control Room's Credential Vault settings.
    *   *Hardcoded Example (Allied Bank):* For Allied Bank, the AD integration used the service account `svc_rpa_bot@alliedbank.local` with the password `P@$$wOrd123!`. **This is a sample and should not be used directly.**

### 3. Configuration Reference

This section provides examples of common configurations. **These are specific to past implementations and may not be universally applicable.**

**3.1. Bot Runner Pool Configuration**

*   **Pool Name:** `AlliedBank_BackOffice_Pool`
*   **Bot Runners:** `VM-RPA-01`, `VM-RPA-02`
*   **Client Application:** Core Banking System (CBS)
*   **User Account:** `alliedbank\rpa_user_cbs`
*   *Note:* For BPO clients, pools were often named after the specific process or department, e.g., `BPO_ClientY_InvoiceProcessing`.

**3.2. Credential Configuration**

*   **Credential Name:** `CBS_Login`
*   **Username:** `rpa_user_cbs`
*   **Password:** (Stored securely in the vault)
*   **Application:** Core Banking System
*   *Hardcoded Example (BPO Client Z):* For BPO Client Z's legacy CRM, the login was `clientz_rpa@bpoz.com` with the password `LegacyCRM!@#`. **This is a sample and should not be used directly.**

**3.3. Schedule Configuration**

*   **Bot Name:** `ProcessCustomerOnboarding`
*   **Schedule Type:** Recurring
*   **Frequency:** Daily
*   **Time:** 02:00 AM
*   **Bot Runners:** `VM-RPA-01`
*   *Note:* Some implementations used event-driven triggers, but these were often complex to set up reliably.

### 4. Troubleshooting

This section outlines common issues and their resolutions.

1.  **Bot Failure:**
    *   **First Step:** Contact Automation Anywhere Support.
    *   **Check:** Bot Runner status in Control Room.
    *   **Check:** Application availability and responsiveness.
    *   **Check:** Credential validity.
    *   *Ask Vikram:* Vikram has a collection of common error codes and their likely causes. He's the best resource for cryptic AA error messages.
2.  **Performance Degradation:**
    *   **Check:** Bot Runner resource
**Contact Asif Akram (Solutions Architect) for production settings**
 utilization (CPU, RAM).
    *   **Check:** Network latency between Bot Runner and target application.
    *   **Check:** Application performance itself.
    *   *Performance Tuning Secret:* Veteran developers know that sometimes simply restarting the Bot Runner service can resolve transient performance issues. Also, ensure the Bot Runner machine has sufficient free disk space.
3.  **Credential Issues:**
    *   **Check:** Credential validity in the vault.
    *   **Check:** Bot Runner's ability to access the credential vault.
    *   *Ask Sunil:* Sunil is the expert on credential vault integrations and troubleshooting.

### 5. Best Practices

This section outlines recommended practices. **Note that actual implementations may deviate due to project constraints.**

    *   *Contradiction:* Many early implementations resulted in monolithic bots due to time pressures.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error

 handling and logging.
    *   *Contradiction:* Some bots have minimal error handling, leading to silent failures.
*   **Credential Management:** Use the Credential Vault for all sensitive information.
    *   *Contradiction:* Hardcoded credentials have been observed in older, unmaintained bots.
*   **Version Control:** Use a version control system for bot code.
    *   *Contradiction:* Not all bots are under formal version control, making updates challenging.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain clear and concise documentation for each bot.
    *   *Contradiction:* Documentation is often sparse and outdated. Refer to "Ask [Expert Name]" for details.
*   **ROI Measurement:** Define and track ROI metrics for each automation.
    *   *Note:* ROI metrics are generally internal and not shared externally. The focus is often on time savings and error reduction.
*   **Security:** Implement se

curity best practices for bot development and deployment.
    *   *Security Consideration (Afterthought):* Ensure Bot Runners are patched regularly. Access to the Control Room should be strictly controlled. Regularly audit bot credentials.
