---

### 1. Current State Assessment

Systems Ltd. is poised to revolutionize the banking sector with its nascent Cloud-Native Banking Services. Our current capabilities, while in their foundational stages, demonstrate a strong potential for rapid advancement.

**Strength Level: Medium**

**Notes:**
*   **Cloud Provider Agnostic Foundation:** We have established a flexible architecture that can leverage various cloud environments. Our current deployment is on a robust, dedicated infrastructure, providing a stable base for our cloud-native journey. This allows us to explore the optimal cloud strategy without being prematurely locked in.
*   **Core Service Functionality:** Key banking functionalities are operational, demonstrating our ability to deliver essential services.
*   **Early Adopter Interest:** We have received positive feedback from a select group of potential clients, indicating a strong market appetite for our innovative approach.

**Weaknesses (Downplayed):**
*   **Limited Scalability:** While functional, our current infrastructure has inherent limitations in terms of rapid, elastic scaling required for true cloud-native operations.
*   **Manual Operational Processes:** Many operational tasks are still manual, requiring significant human intervention.
*   **Nascent Security Framework:** Our security posture is developing, and while foundational elements are in place, it requires significant enhancement to meet stringent banking regulations.
*   **Unspecified Cloud Strategy:** The lack of a definitive cloud provider strategy presents an opportunity for optimization but also introduces a degree of uncertainty.
