### 1. Current State Assessment

Systems Ltd. has established a foundational Robotic Process Automation (RPA) capability, demonstrating a growing understanding of process optimization through automation. Our current strength level is **Medium**, reflecting a solid base of implemented automations and a dedicated, albeit lean, internal team.

**Key Strengths:**

*   **Existing Automation Footprint:** We have successfully deployed RPA solutions across several key business units, delivering tangible efficiency gains.
*   **Internal Expertise:** A core team of skilled RPA developers and analysts is in place, possessing the technical acumen to build and maintain
[RISK: ROI metrics generally internal only, automation scope sometimes limited not addressed]
 automations.
*   **Growing Awareness:** Internal stakeholders are increasingly recognizing the potential of RPA to drive operational excellence and cost savings.

**Areas for Enhancement (Downplayed Weaknesses):**

*   **ROI Visibility:** While internal ROI metrics are tracked, there's an opportunity to enhance external communication and standardization of these metrics for broader stakeholder buy-in.
*   **Automation Scope:** Current automation scope is sometimes limited by initial project definitions. We are actively exploring opportunities to expand the breadth and depth of our RPA deployments.
*   **Scalability Framework:** We are in the process of formalizing a scalable framework for RPA development and deployment to ensure consistent quality and faster delivery.
