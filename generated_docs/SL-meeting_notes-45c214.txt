## Project Crisis Meeting Notes - SL-1996-2025

**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Time:** 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM PKT
**Location:** Virtual (Microsoft Teams)

**Project:** PTCL Digital Transformation Initiative - Aurora AI Platform Integration
**Project Code:** SL-1996-2025

**Systems Ltd Attendees:**
*   Sana Mahmood (Business Analyst)
*   Bilal Ahmed (Technical Lead)

**PTCL Attendees:**
*   [CTO Representative] (CTO Rep)
*   [Head of Operations] (HoO)
*   [IT Manager] (ITM)

**Meeting Objective:** Address critical issues impacting the successful integration of Systems Ltd's Aurora AI Platform with PTCL's existing infrastructure and operations.

---

**Discussion Points & Notes:**

*   **Aurora AI Platform Integration Overview:**
    *   Sana: Recap of current integration status. Focus on **Collections Hub** and **Loan Origination** modules.
    *   CTO Rep: Expressed significant concern about the pace. "We're falling behind. What's the real hold-up?"
    *   Bilal: Integration complexity higher than initially scoped. Data mapping challenges with legacy PTCL systems.

*   **Customization Scope Disagreements:**
    *   HoO: "We need the **Collections Hub** to mirror our existing manual workflows precisely. The current proposed solution is too generic."
    *   Sana: "The proposed configuration aligns with Aurora's best practices for efficiency. Extensive customization will impact timelines and budget."
    *   CTO Rep: "Budget is a concern, yes, but functionality is paramount. We can't afford a system that doesn't serve our core needs. This isn't just about a new platform; it's about operational continuity."
    *   ITM: "The SBP compliance for collections is very specific. We need to ensure the system can handle the reporting and audit trails as per their guidelines. UAE Central Bank requirements also need to be factored in for future phases."
    *   Bilal: "The level of customization requested for **Collections Hub** workflow automation is pushing us into significant code changes. This wasn't in the original SOW for Phase 1."
    *   Sana: "We need to clarify the exact delta between Aurora's out-of-the-box capabilities and PTCL's absolute must-have cust
[CLIENT SENSITIVE: Redacted competitive information]
omizations for SBP compliance. TBD - check with Systems Ltd architect on feasibility of phased customization rollout."

*   **Pricing & Budget Constraints:**
    *   CTO Rep: "The current projected costs for the additional customization are significantly higher than anticipated. We operate within strict budget constraints for this region. Can we re-evaluate the USD pricing for Pakistan/Middle East market context?"
    *   Sana: "The pricing reflects the engineering effort. We can explore options for phased implementation of certain advanced features, but core functionality remains as quoted."
    *   HoO: "We need a clear breakdown of costs per module and per customization request. This feels like scope creep without proper change control."

*   **Timeline Delays & Client Concerns:**
    *   HoO: "The original go-live date is no longer realistic. We've communicated this internally, but the lack of clear progress is causing significant internal pressure."
    *   CTO Rep: "We need a revised, realistic timeline with clear milestones and accountability. What are the immediate steps to get back on track?"
    *   Bilal: "The Karachi development team is working on the core integration, but the customization requests are

diverting resources. We need a deci
[ACTION: Schedule follow-up with Systems Ltd COE team]
sion on the scope to provide an accurate revised timeline."

*   **Technical Debt & COE Involvement:**
    *   ITM: "We've observed some performance bottlenecks during testing, particularly with the data ingestion for **Loan Origination**. Is this related to technical debt from previous integrations?"
    *   Bilal: "There might be some legacy code dependencies that need refactoring. This is something our COE teams in Lahore would need to assess. TBD - check with Systems Ltd COE for technical debt assessment report on existing integration points."
    *   Sana: "We need to prioritize addressing any technical debt that directly impacts the Aurora integration performance. Thi
[Discussing off-topic: Ramadan working hours]
s needs to be a joint effort."

**Action Items:**

*   **Systems Ltd:**
    *   Provide a detailed breakdown of customization requests for **Collections Hub** and **Loan Origination** with estimated effort and cost implications. (Owner: Sana)
    *   Develop a revised project timeline with clear, achievable milestones, factoring in agreed-upon scope. (Owner: Bilal)
    *   Karachi development team to focus on core Aurora integration for **Loan Origination** data ingestion, addressing immediate performance issues. (Owner: Bilal)
    *   Systems Ltd COE (Lahore) to conduct a rapid assessment of technical debt impacting current integration performance. (Owner: Bilal)
    *   Systems Ltd COE to provide recommendations for optimizing data ingestion for **Loan Origination**. (Owner: Bilal)
    *   Sana to follow up with Systems Ltd Architect regarding feasibility of phased customization rollout for **Collections Hub**. (Owner: Sana)

*   **PTCL:**
    *   Provide definitive clarification on absolute must-have customizations for SBP compliance in **Collections Hub**. (Owner: ITM)
    *   Confirm budget allocation for potential scope adjustments. (Owner: CTO Rep)

**Follow-up:**

*   Next meeting scheduled for **October 30, 2023, 10:00 AM PKT** to review revised timeline and cost breakdown.
*   Systems Ltd COE to provide initial findings on technical debt by **October 28, 2023**.
