**Location:** Habib Bank Limited Head Office, Karachi (Virtual Link Provided)

**Project Code:** SL-2143-2025

**Systems Ltd Attendees:**
* Asif Akram (Project Manager)
* Kamran Ali (Security Consultant)

**Meeting Objective:** Review proposed solution for Habib Bank Limited's digital transformation initiative, focusing on integration with Nexus Core Banking platform.

---

**Discussion Points:**

1.  **Introduction & Project Overview (Asif Akram)**
    *   Brief recap of project goals.
    *   Systems Ltd's understanding of HBL's strategic objectives.
    *   Confirmation of scope: Nexus Core integration, specific modules.

2.  **Nexus Core Integration Deep Dive (Kamran Ali & IT Mgr)**
    *   **Modules:** Focus on **Collections Hub** and **Loan Origination**

.
    *   **Integration Points:** API strategy, data mapping.
    *   **IT Mgr:** "How robust is the API for real-time data sync with existing HBL systems? Specifically for loan origination, we need seamless flow from application to disbursement."
    *   **Kamran Ali:** "APIs are designed for real-time. We've done similar integrations. Need to confirm specific data fields for HBL's legacy systems. TBD - check with Systems Ltd architect on exact data transformation logic for Collections Hub."
    *   **CTO Rep:** "Concerned about performance impact on Nexus Core during peak loads. Any benchmarks?"
    *   **Kamran Ali:** "We have performance testing protocols. Will share results from similar deployments. Need to understand HBL's expected transaction volumes for Collections Hub."

3.  **Customization Scope & Disagreements (Asif Akram & HoOps)**
    *   **HoOps:** "The proposed workflow for loan origination has too many manual steps. We need more automation, especially for credit scoring integration. This wasn't in the initial SOW."
    *   **Asif Akram:** "The current proposal reflects standard Nexus Core functionality. Additional automation for credit scoring would be a significant customization, impacting timeline and budget. We need to define the exact scope of this."
    *   **HoOps:** "But the market demands faster processing. We can't afford to be slow. This is critical for our competitive edge."
    *   **Asif Akram:** "Understood. We can explore a phased approach for advanced automation. Let's document the specific requirements for credit scoring integration."
    *   **IT Mgr:** "The Collections Hub also needs some UI tweaks to match our branding and user experience. Minor changes, but important for adoption."
    *   **Asif Akram:** "UI customization is generally manageable, but we need to be clear on the extent. This could add to the development effort."

4.  **Pricing & Budget Constraints (Asif Akram)**
    *   **Asif Akram:** "Based on the current scope, the estimated licensing and implementation cost is approximately $1.2M USD. This includes the Nexus Core modules and integration services."
    *   **HoOps:** "That's higher than our initial budget allocation for this phase. We have significant budget constraints in the Pakistan/Middle East market this year."
    *   **Asif Akram:** "We understand the regional budget realities. We can look at options for phasing the implementation or prioritizing modules. Perhaps a phased rollout of Collections Hub first?"
    *   **CTO Rep:** "We need a breakdown of costs per module and per phase. Also, what are the ongoing support and maintenance costs?"
    *   **Asif Akram:** "Will provide a detailed cost breakdown by module and phase. Ongoing costs are typically X% of licensing annually, plus support packages. Will confirm exact figures."

5.  **Regional Compliance (Kamran Ali)**
    *   **Kamran Ali:** "We've ensured Nexus Core and its modules are compliant with SBP regulations for core banking operations. For UAE Central Bank, we've incorporated necessary data residency and security controls."
    *   **IT Mgr:** "Can you provide specific documentation on how the solution addresses UAE Central Bank's requirements for data privacy and cybersecurity? We need to present this to our com

pliance team."
    *   **Kamran Ali:** "Yes, we have a compliance matrix. Will share that. Also, need to confirm if there are any specific localizations required for the Collections Hub beyond standard SBP compliance."

6.  **Technical Debt & COE Follow-ups (Asif Akram)**
    *   **CTO Rep:** "We've heard concerns about technical debt in some of Systems Ltd's previous deployments. How are you managing this with Nexus Core?"
    *   **Asif Akram:** "We have a dedicated COE for Nexus Core. They focus on code quality and minimizing technical debt. We can arrange a separate session with the COE lead to discuss their practices and how they address legacy code integration."
    *   **Kamran Ali:** "For the integration layer, we're using microservices architecture, which helps manage technical debt. However, the legacy systems at HBL might introduce some challenges. TBD - check with Systems Ltd architect on potential technical debt implications from HBL's legacy systems."
    *   **Action Item:** Systems Ltd COE to provide documentation on technical debt management strategies for Nexus Core.

7.  **Timeline Concerns (HoOps)**
    
[Systems Ltd architect joined late due to timezone difference]
*   **HoOps:** "The proposed timeline of 12 months for full rollout seems aggressive, especially with the potential for customization. We've experienced delays in past projects with other vendors."
    *   **Asif Akram:** "We've factored in standard development and testing cycles. The key to staying on track will be timely feedback and decision-making from HBL, and clear definition of any additional customization scope. We will need dedicated resources from HBL for UAT and integration testing."
    *   **IT Mgr:** "We will assign dedicated resources. What are the key milestones and dependencies?"
    *   **Asif Akram:** "Will provide a detailed project plan with milestones and dependencies. Our Karachi development team is ready to commence once the SOW is finalized."

**Action Items:**

*   **Systems Ltd:**
    *   Provide detailed cost breakdown by module and phase.
    *   Provide compliance matrix for UAE Central Bank.
    *   Share performance testing results from similar deployments.
    *   Provide detailed project plan with milestones and dependencies.
    *   Karachi development team to investigate specific data transformation logic for Collections Hub (TBD - check with Systems Ltd architect).
    *   COE to provide documentation on technical debt management strategies for Nexus Core.
    *   Arrange session with Nexus Core COE lead to discuss practices.
*   **Habib Bank Limited:**
    *   Provide expected transaction volumes for Collections Hub.
    *   Assign dedicated resources for UAT and integration testing.
    *   Provide specific requirements for credit scoring automation in Loan Origination.

tion requirements for Collections Hub.

**Next Steps:**

*   Systems Ltd to provide requested documentation and cost breakdown by EOD November 2nd, 2023.
*   Follow-up meeting to be scheduled once documentation is reviewed, tentatively the week of November 6th, 2023.

**Notes:**
*   Meeting was productive, but significant concerns remain regarding budget and customization scope.
*   Need to ensure clear communication and alignment on customization requirements to avoid scope creep and timeline delays.
*   Technical debt discussion needs further engagement with Systems Ltd COE.
*   Karachi development team needs to be prepared for detailed technical discussions on integration points.
