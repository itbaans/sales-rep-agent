**Meet
[Discussing off-topic: Ramadan working hours]
ing Objective:** Address critical issues impacting SL-9514-2025 project timeline and scope.

**Discussion Points:**

1.  **Nexus Core Banking Integration Status:**

ss. Seems slower than expected.
    *   CTO Rep: Yes, significant delays. Client team flagging issues with Nexus Core. Specifically, the **Collections Hub** module integration is problematic.
    *   HoOps: Also concerned about **Loan Origination** module. Data mappi

ng issues.
    *   Ayesha: UX flows for Loan Origination need client sign-off. Delays in feedback.
    *   ITM: Technical debt on our side impacting integration speed. Need clarity on Systems Ltd's approach to handling this.

2.  **Scope Disagreements & Customization:**
    *   CTO Rep: We requested specific customizations for Collections Hub to align with SBP regulations. Systems Ltd's understanding of "customization" seems different from ours.
    *   Hina: We understood it as configuration within Nexus. Extensive code changes weren't budgeted.
    *   HoOps: But the UAE Central Bank compliance also requires certain workflows. This isn't just SBP.
    *   ITM: The current implementation is too generic. We need it tailored.
    *   Hina: TBD - check with Systems Ltd architect on the exact nature of requested changes vs. standard configuration.
    *   CTO Rep: This is impacting our go-live date. We're already behind.

3.  **Pricing & Budget:**
    *   CTO Rep: The initial USD 1.5M quote was for standard integration. These customizations are adding significant cost.
    *   Hina: We need to re-evaluate the scope and provide a revised quote. The Pakistan/Middle East market context means budget constraints are real for clients.
    *   HoOps: We can't absorb unlimited cost increases. Need a clear breakdown of additional costs for each customization.
    *   ITM: Are these customizations impacting the core platform's stability?

4.  **Timeline Delays & Client Concerns:**
    *   HoOps: Our internal teams are ready. The delay is entirely on the integration side. This impacts our Q1 2025 launch targets.
    *   CTO Rep: We need a concrete recovery plan. What are Systems Ltd's Karachi development team doing to expedite?
    *   Hina: We are prioritizing the critical path items. The Karachi team is working on the data mapping fixes.

5.  **Technical Debt:**
    *   ITM: We've identified technical debt in the Nexus Core platform that's hindering our ability to integrate smoothly. Specifically, legacy code in the Collections Hub.
    *   Hina: We need to understand the extent of this debt. This requires involvement from our COE teams.
    *   CTO Rep: This is a Systems Ltd issue. We expect you to manage it.
