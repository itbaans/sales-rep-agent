**Meeting Objective:** Discuss and negotiate Change Request (CR) #003 for enhanced integrat
[ACTION: Schedule follow-up with Systems Ltd COE team]
ion of Jazz Telecom's systems with Systems Ltd's Nimbus Mobile Banking platform.

**Key Discussion Points:**

*   **CR #003 Overview:** Asif presented the CR, focusing on deeper integration points beyond initial scope. Specifically, enabling direct data flow from Nimbus Collections Hub to Jazz's internal collections management system. Also, a new requirement for real-time loan origination status updates from Jazz's platform back into Nimbus.

*   **Integration Scope & Complexity:**
    *   CTO Rep: "We need seamless data sync. Current integration is too basic. Collections Hub needs to push delinquent account data directly. Loan Origination needs to reflect status changes instantly."
    *   Kamran: "The Collections Hub integration, especially the real-time push, requires significant API development on our end. We're talking about new endpoints, robust error handling, and potentially a webhook mechanism. This wasn't in the original SOW."
    *   HoO: "But this is critical for our operational efficiency. We can't have manual data entry for collections follow-ups. And loan origination status is vital for customer experience."
    *   ITM: "What about the Loan Origination module? Is it just read-only access or bi-directional? The CR implies bi-directional for status updates."
    *   Asif: "The CR specifies bi-directional for loan origination status. This means we need to expose an API on our side for Jazz to push updates. This is a substantial change."
    *   CTO Rep: "We assumed this level of integration was part of the Nimbus platform's capabilities. It's a mobile banking platform, right?"
    *   Kamran: "Nimbus is highly configurable, but the depth of integration you're asking for, especially the real-time push from Collections Hub and bi-directional for Loan Origination, goes beyond the standard integration package. It requires custom development."

*   **Pricing & Budget:**
    *   Asif: "Based on our initial assessment, the additional development effort for these integrations is estimated at **$75,000 USD**. This covers the API development, testing, and deployment for both modules. This is a significant uplift from the original project budget."
    *   CTO Rep: "That's a substantial increase. Our budget for this phase is already tight, especially considering the Pakistan and Middle East market dynamics. We need to understand the breakdown."
    *   HoO: "Yes, we have budget constraints. Can we phase this? Perhaps start with Collections Hub and defer Loan Origination?"
    *   Asif: "We can explore phasing, but the core development effort for the APIs will still be required. The $75k is for the complete scope outlined in CR #003."
    *   ITM: "What's the cost of just the Collections Hub integration? And just the Loan Origination?"
    *   Asif: "TBD - need to get a detailed breakdown from Karachi dev team. Likely around $40k for Collections Hub and $35k for Loan Origination, but this is a rough estimate."

*   **Compliance & Security:**
    *   Kamran: "From a security perspective, we need to ensure all data exchange adheres to SBP (State Bank of Pakistan) and UAE Central Bank regulations. This includes encryption, access controls, and audit trails. The proposed integration points will be secured with OAuth 2.0 and TLS 1.2."
    *   CTO Rep: "Absolutely. Compliance is non-negotiable. Are there any specific data residency requirements we need to be aware of for this integration?"
    *   Kamran: "TBD - need to confirm with Systems Ltd COE Security team regarding data residency implications of real-time data pushes between systems."
    *   ITM: "What about the existing technical debt in the Nimbus platform that might impact this integration? We've heard concerns from our internal teams."
    *   Asif: "We acknowledge some areas of technical debt in Nimbus, particularly around legacy components. Our Karachi development team is actively working on refactoring. However, for these new integration points, we'll be building on the latest architecture. We'll need to ensure the integration doesn't exacerbate existing issues."
    *   Kamran: "We'll need to involve our COE for a thorough impact analysis on technical debt. Specifically, how the new APIs interact with existing data models."

*   **Timeline & Delays:**
    *   HoO: "Our primary concern is timeline. We are already facing pressure to launch these enhanced features. Any delay in this integration will directly impact our go-to-market strategy."
    *   Asif: "The original project timeline is already tight. Adding this CR will likely push the completion date by **4-6 weeks**, assuming we can get a swift sign-off and resource allocation. This includes development, testing, and UAT."
    *   CTO Rep: "4-6 weeks is unacceptable. We need this within 2-3 weeks. Can your Karachi team expedite this?"
    *   Asif: "We can explore expediting, but it will likely incur additional costs for overtime and potentially parallel development streams. We need to be realistic about the complexity."

*   **Disagreements & Concerns:**
    *   **Customization Scope:** Jazz Telecom pushing for deeper, real-time integration than initially scoped. Systems Ltd highlighting the custom development effort and associated costs.
    *   **Timeline:** Jazz Telecom's aggressive timeline vs. Systems Ltd's realistic estimation for complex integration.
    *   **Budget:** Jazz Telecom's budget constraints vs. the cost of the requested enhancements.

**Notes:**

*   Client seemed keen on the functionality but very sensitive to cost and timeline.
*   Need to manage expectations regarding the "out-of-the-box" capabilities of Nimbus for such deep integrations.
*   Technical debt discussion needs careful handling with COE input.
*   Market context (Pakistan/Middle East) is crucial for pricing and compliance discussions.
