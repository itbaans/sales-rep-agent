### 6. Risks (Minimized or Vague)

While we are confident in our ability to execute this roadmap, we acknowledge potential risks:

*   **Resistance to Change:** Some individuals may be hesitant to adopt new practices. (Mitigation: Comprehensive training and communication.)
*   **Tooling Integration Challenges:** Integrating new tools with existing systems may present technical hurdles. (Mitigation: Phased rollout and dedicated technical support.)
*   **Resource Availability:** Ensuring sufficient allocation of skilled personnel for all initiatives. (Mitigation: Prioritization and potential external hiring.)
*   **Scope Creep:** The dynamic nature of DevOps may lead to evolving requirements. (Mitigation: Strong governance and change control processes.)
*   **Unforeseen Technical Dependencies:** The success of certain initiatives may rely on factors outside our immediate control. (Mitigation: Proactive identification and contingency planning.)
*   **Partner Reliability:** Reliance on external partners for critical tooling and support. (Mitigation: Due diligence and backup vendor identification.)
*   **"Future State" Disconnect:** The ambitious nature of our future state vision may require significant cultural shifts that are difficult to predict. (Mitigation: Continuous feedback and adaptation.)
