## Systems Ltd. Data & Analytics / Data Warehousing Capability Playbook

**Version:** 1.3 (Last Updated: 2023-10-27)

**Purpose:** This playbook outlines the technical implementation steps and considerations for building and managing credit-risk data warehouses for our GCC banking clients. It aims to guide project teams through the process, acknowledging the realities of our current implementations and the need for expert intervention.

---

### 1. Architecture Overview

Our standard data warehousing solution for GCC banking clients typically involves the following core components. Note that specific implementations may vary significantly based on client infrastructure and legacy systems.

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Core Banking Systems (e.g., Temenos T24, Finacle)
    *   Loan Origination Systems
    *   Credit Bureau Feeds (e.g., SIMAH, Al Etihad Credit Bureau)
    *   Internal Risk Management Systems
    *   *Missing Component: Detailed mapping of specific data elements from each source.*

*   **Data Ingestion Layer:**
    *   **ETL/ELT Tools:** Informatica PowerCenter, Talend, custom Python scripts.
    *   **Real-time Streaming:** Kafka (for near real-time feeds).
    *   **Batch Processing:** Scheduled jobs via cron or enterprise schedulers.
    *   *Missing Component: Diagram illustrating data flow from sources to staging.*

*   **Staging Area:**
    *   Temporary storage for raw, un-transformed data.
    *   Typically hosted on a dedicated database instance (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server).
    *   *Note: Staging schema design is often ad-hoc and client-specific.*

*   **Data Warehouse Core:**
    *   **Database Platform:** Oracle Exadata (preferred for performance), SQL Server Enterprise, Snowflake (emerging).
    *   **Dimensional Modeling:** Star schema and snowflake schema variations.
    *   **Fact Tables:** Transactional data, credit events, loan performance.
    *   **Dimension Tables:** Customer, product, branch, time, risk rating.
    *   *Missing Component: ER Diagram of a typical credit-risk data warehouse schema.*

*   **Data Marts:**
    *   Subject-oriented subsets of the data warehouse for specific user groups (e.g., Credit Risk Analysts, Portfolio Managers).
    *   Often denormalized for faster querying.

*   **Analytics & Reporting Layer:**
    *   **BI Tools:** Tableau, Power BI, QlikView.
    *   **SQL Access:** Direct querying for ad-hoc analysis.
    *   *Implementation Note: Analytics layer inconsistency is a known issue. Users often build their own local datasets or spreadsheets, leading to data silos.*

*   **Orchestration & Scheduling:**
    *   Control-M, Autosys, or custom scheduling scripts.

### 2. Setup Guide

This section provides a high-level guide to setting up the data warehousing environment. Specific configurations are highly dependent on the client's existing infrastructure.

**2.1. Environment Provisioning**

*   **Development Environment:**
    *   **Database:** Oracle 19c (or latest stable) on a Linux VM.
    *   **ETL Tool:** Informatica PowerCenter 10.x installed on a separate Windows server.
    *   **Client-Specific:** For a recent project in **Riyadh**, we used a dedicated Oracle RAC cluster for the DW. **Ask Ahmed Hassan** for the specific RAC configuration details.
    *   **Networking:** Ensure proper firewall rules are in place to allow access from ETL servers to the database.

*   **Staging Environment:**
    *   Similar to Development, but often with more robust hardware.
    *   **Gotcha:** For the **Dubai** project, the staging database was hosted on a shared SQL Server inst
**Contact Sana Mahmood (Capability Manager) for production settings**
ance, leading to performance contention. Ensure dedicated resources if possible.

*   **Production Environment:**
    *   **Database:** Oracle Exadata X8M (or equivalent high-performance appliance).
    *   **ETL Servers:** Clustered Informatica servers for high availability.
    *   **Client-Specific:** The **Abu Dhabi** implementation utilized a Snowflake data warehouse. **Ask Fatima Al Mansoori** for the Snowflake connection strings and role-based access control setup.

**2.2. ETL Tool Installation & Configuration**

*   **Informatica PowerCenter:**
    1.  Install Informatica Domain, Integration Service, and Repository Service.
    2.  Configure ODBC drivers for connecting to the database.
    3.  **Hardcoded Value:** The Informatica repository database connection string often uses `jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=dbserver.client.local)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=ORCL)))`. **Do not change this without consulting the lead architect.**
    4.  Set up the Informatica client tools on developer machines.

*   **Talend:**
    1.  Install Talend Studio.
    2.  Configure database connections within Talend.
    3.  *Deprecated Approach:* Older projects sometimes used custom Perl scripts for data extraction. While still functional, these are not recommended for new development.

**2.3. Database Setup**

*   **Schema Creation:**
    *   Execute DDL scripts provided by the lead data modeler.
    *   **Incomplete Step:** Ensure tablespaces are correctly sized and configured for optimal I/O. **Ask Karim El-Sayed** for the specific tablespace recommendations for Exadata.

*   **User & Role Management:**
    *   Create dedicated database users for ETL processes, reporting tools, and end-users.
    *   Grant appropriate privileges. **Security Consideration:** Avoid granting `DBA` privileges to ETL service accounts.

**2.4. Kafka Setup (for near real-time)**

*   Install and configure Kafka brokers and Zookeeper.
*   Set up Kafka topics for different data streams.
*   Develop Kafka producers to push data from source systems.
*   Develop Kafka consumers to ingest data into the staging area.
*   *Missing Component: Diagram of Kafka data flow and consumer architecture.*

### 3. Configuration Reference

This section provides examples of common configurations. **These are sample values and must be adapted to the specific client environment.**

**3.1. Informatica Workflow Configuration**

*   **Workflow Name:** `WF_CreditRisk_Load_CustomerDim`
*   **Schedule:** Daily at 02:00 AM.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `$$SourceSystem`: `CoreBanking`
    *   `$$LoadDate`: `2023-10-27`
*   **Connection Overrides:**
    *   **Source Connection:** `Oracle_Client_Staging`
    *   **Target Connection:** `Oracle_DW_Production`
*   **Hardcoded Value Example:** In a specific mapping, the filter condition for active customers might be `CustomerStatus = 'ACTIVE'` or `CustomerStatus = 'A'`. **Ask the senior ETL developer for the correct status code.**

**3.2. Snowflake Configuration (Example)**

*   **Warehouse:** `CREDIT_RISK_WH`
*   **Database:** `GCC_BANK_DW`
*   **Schema:** `ANALYTICS`
*   **User:** `reporting_user`
*   **Role:** `ANALYST_ROLE`
*   **Query Example:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        c.customer_name,
        l.loan_amount,
        r.risk_rating
    FROM
        GCC_BANK_DW.ANALYTICS.dim_customer c
    JOIN
        GCC_BANK_DW.ANALYTICS.fact_loan_performance l ON c.customer_key = l.customer_key
    JOIN
        GCC_BANK_DW.ANALYTICS.dim_risk_rating r ON l.risk_rating_key = r.risk_rating_key
    WHERE
        l.reporting_date = '2023-10-26'
        AND r.rating_grade IN ('AA', 'A');
    ```
*   **Hardcoded Value:** The `reporting_date` is often hardcoded in ad-hoc queries. **This is a bad practice and should be parameterized.**

**3.3. Tableau Data Source Configuration**

*   **Connection Type:** Oracle
*   **Connection String:** `jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=exadata.client.local)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=DWPROD)))`
*   **Username:** `tableau_user`
*   **Password:** (Stored securely, or us
[CONFIGURATION: Environment-specific values not parameterized]
e Kerberos authentication if available)
*   **Custom SQL:** Often used to pre-aggregate data or apply complex filters. **Ask the BI Lead for approved custom SQL snippets.**

### 4. Troubleshooting

This section outlines common issues and their resolution.

1.  **ETL Job Failure:**
    *   **First Step:** Check the ETL tool's execution logs for specific error messages.
    *   **Common Cause:** Database connection issues, invalid SQL, data type mismatches, insufficient disk space on the ETL server.
    *   **Client-Specific:** For the **Qatar** project, ETL jobs failed due to network latency between the on-premise ETL server and the cloud-hosted database. **Ask the Network Engineer for assistance.**
    *   **If unresolved:** **Contact Support (Internal Helpdesk)** with detailed error logs.

2.  **Slow Query Performance:**
    *   **Check Execution Plans:** Analyze the SQL quer

y execution plan to identify bottlenecks.
    *   **Indexing:** Ensure appropriate indexes are present on fact and dimension tables. **Ask the DBA for index recommendations.**
    *   **Partitioning:** Verify that tables are partitioned correctly, especially for large fact tables.
    *   **Hardcoded Value:** A common performance issue arises from using `SELECT *` in ETL mappings. **Always specify required columns.**
    *   **Veteran Secret:** Sometimes, simply rebuilding statistics on key tables can dramatically improve performance. **Ask the senior DBA for the optimal statistics gathering strategy.**

3.  **Data Inconsistency:**
    *   **Source System Validation:** Cross-reference data in the data warehouse with the source systems.
    *   **ETL Logic Review:** Carefully review the ETL mapping logic for any errors in transformations or aggregations.
    *   **Implementation Note:** Inconsistent analytics layer usage often leads to perceived data inconsistency. **Educate users on the correct way to access and interpret data.**
    *   **If unresolved:** **Contact the Data Governance team.**

4.  **Near Real-time Latency Issues:**
    *   **Kafka Consumer Lag:** Monitor Kafka consumer lag to identify processing delays.
    *   **Staging Database Load:** Ensure the staging database can handle the ingestion rate.
    *   **Network Bandwidth:
**TODO: Add architecture here**
** Verify sufficient network bandwidth for streaming data.
    *   **Ask the Kafka Administrator for monitoring tools and best practices.

### 5. Best Practices

These are the ideal practices for data warehousing. **Note that actual implementations often deviate from these due to project constraints and legacy systems.**

*   **Data Governance:** Establish clear data ownership, definitions, and quality standards.
    *   *Contradiction:* In many projects, data governance is an afterthought, leading to inconsistent data definitions and quality issues.

*   **Dimensional Modeling:** Design robust star or snowflake schemas for optimal query performance and understandability.
    *   *Contradiction:* Some implementations use highly normalized structures or denormalized "flat files" for reporting, making maintenance difficult.

*   **ETL/ELT Best Practices:**
    *   Use parameterized queries.
    *   Implement robust error handling and logging.
    *   Avoid hardcoded values in ETL mappings.
    *   *Contradiction:* Hardcoded values are prevalent in many existing ETL jobs due to expediency.

*   **Performance Tuning:**
    *   Regularly monitor database performance.
    *   Optimize queries and ensure proper indexing.
    *   Utilize partitioning and materialized views where appropriate.
    *   *Contradiction:* Performance tuning is often reactive, performed only when critical issues arise.

*   **Security:**
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) at all levels.
    *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    *   Regularly audit access logs.
    *   *Security Consideration as Afterthought:* Security is often addressed late in the project lifecycle, leading to rushed implementations and potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation for architecture, data models, ETL processes, and reporting logic.
    *   *Contradiction:* Documentation is often sparse, outdated, or incomplete, relying heavily on tribal knowledge.
