### 2. Setup Guide

This section provides a step-by-step guide for setting up the Cloud-Native Banking Services environment. **Note:** Environment-specific configurations are
<!-- Actual implementation differs for Banking clients -->
 critical and may require adjustments.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Access to the chosen cloud provider (e.g., PTCL Cloud, Azure, AWS, GCP) or dedicated infrastructure.
*   Kubernetes cluster provisioned and accessible.
*   Necessary IAM roles and permissions configured.
*   Docker images for all microservices available in a container registry.

**Step 1: Provisioning Infrastructure**

1.  **Cloud Provider Setup:**
    *   **PTCL Dedicated Infrastructure:**
        *   Ensure compute, storage, and networking resources are allocated as per the "PTCL Infrastructure Allocation Guide" (Internal Document: `\\fileserver\docs\PTCL_Infra_Alloc_v1.2.docx`).
        *   **Gotcha:** Network segmentation on PTCL infrastructure requires specific VLAN configurations. Consult with the PTCL Network Team for VLAN ID assignments and routing rules.
    *   **Public Cloud (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP):**
        *   Create Virtual Networks (VNets) or Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).
        *   Configure subnets, security groups/network security groups, and route tables.
        *   **Gotcha:** For Azure, ensure the `Microsoft.ContainerService` resource provider is registered. For AWS, ensure the `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistry` service is enabled.

2.  **Kubernetes Cluster Configuration:**
    *   **If using managed Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE):**
        *   Create a cluster with at least 3 worker nodes for high availability.
        *   Configure node pools with appropriate instance types (e.g., `m5.large` for AWS, `Standard_D4s_v3` for Azure).
        *   **Gotcha:** Ensure the Kubernetes version is compatible with the deployed container images. Check the "Container Image Compatibility Matrix" (Internal Wiki: `/images/compatibility`).
    *   **If using on-premise Kubernetes:**
        *   Ensure the cluster meets the minimum resource requirements outlined in the "On-Premise Kubernetes Deployment Guide" (Internal Document: `\\fileserver\docs\OnPrem_K8s_Deploy_v1.0.pdf`).
        *   **Gotcha:** For on-premise deployments, ensure proper integration with existing network infrastructure and storage solutions.

**Step 2: Deploying Core Banking System (CBS)**

1.  **CBS Deployment:**
    *   The CBS is typically deployed as a set of stateful applications.
    *   **Deprecated Approach:** Older versions of the CBS might have been deployed using direct VM deployments. **Avoid this for new implementations.**
    *   **Current Approach:** Deploy CBS components using Kubernetes StatefulSets.
    *   **Hardcoded Value Example:** For the CBS database, the initial connection pool size might be set to `100`. This value is derived from the "Sample CBS Deployment for Bank XYZ" (Internal Document: `\\fileserver\docs\BankXYZ_CBS_Deploy_v1.5.docx`).
    *   **Ask:** **Ask Rajesh Sharma** for the specific Kubernetes manifests for the CBS.

**Step 3: Deploying Digital Banking Platform (DBP)**

1.  **DBP Deployment:**
    *   Deploy DBP components (web, mobile backend) as Kubernetes Deployments.
    *   Configure Ingress resources for external access.
    *   **Gotcha:** For DBP, ensure SSL termination is handled at the Ingress level. Use certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Step 4: Deploying Microservices**

1.  **Microservice Deployment:**
    *   Deploy each microservice as a Kubernetes Deployment.
    *   Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for services expected to experience variable load.
    *   **Hardcoded Value Example:** The `account-service` might have an initial replica count of `3`. This is based on the "Sample Microservice Deployment for Bank ABC" (Internal Document: `\\fileserver\docs\BankABC_Microservices_Deploy_v1.1.docx`).
    *   **Ask:** **Ask Priya Singh** for the specific Kubernetes manifests for each microservice.

**Step 5: Configuring Data Stores**

1.  **Relational Database:**
    *   Provision a managed relational database service or deploy PostgreSQL/Oracle on Kubernetes.
    *   Configure connection pooling and security.
    *   **Gotcha:** For PTCL infrastructure, ensure the database is deployed within the designated secure network segment.

2.  **NoSQL Database:**
    *   Provision a managed NoSQL service or deploy MongoDB/Cassandra on Kubernetes.
    *   Configure replication and sharding as per performance requirements.

**Step 6: Setting up CI/CD Pipeline**

1.  **CI/CD Tooling:**
    *   Integrate with Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, or GitHub Actions.
    *   Configure build jobs to build Docker images.
    *   Configure deployment jobs to deploy Kubernetes manifests.
    *   **Gotcha:** Ensure the CI/CD pipeline has appropriate credentials to access the container registry and Kubernetes cluster.

**Step 7: Monitoring and Logging**

1.  **Monitoring Tools:**
 
[CONFIGURATION: Environment-specific values not parameterized]
   *   Deploy Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection and visualization.
    *   Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Kubernetes pods and nodes.
    *   **Ask:** **Ask Amit Patel** for the Prometheus scrape configurations.
2.  **Logging Tools:**
    *   Deploy Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK stack) or Loki, Promtail, and Grafana (PLG stack) for centralized logging.
    *   Configure Fluentd/Promtail to collect logs from all pods.
    *   **Gotcha:** Ensure log retention policies are configured to meet compliance requirements.

### 4. Troubleshooting

This section outlines common issues and their resolutions. **Always start by contacting support.**

1.  **Contact Support:** If you encounter an issue not listed here, or if the provided solutions do not resolve the problem, please open a ticket with the Systems Ltd. Support team. Provide detailed logs, error messages, and environment information.

2.  **Pod Not Starting:**
    *   **Check Pod Logs:** `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>`
    *   **Check Events:** `kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>`
    *   **Common Causes:** Image pull errors, insufficient resources, misconfigured environment variables, incorrect command in the container spec.
    *   **Gotcha:** Sometimes, a simple `kubectl delete pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>` followed by the deployment recreating it can resolve transient issues.

3.  **Service Not Accessible:**
    *   **Check Service Definition:** `kubectl get svc <service-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml`
    *   **Check EndpointS:** `kubectl get endpoints <service-name> -n <namespace>`
    *   **Check Network Policies:** If network policies are in place, ensure they allow traffic to the service.
    *   **Gotcha:** Ensure the `targetPort` in the Service definition matches the `containerPort` in the Pod.

4.  **Performance Degradation:**
    *   **Monitor Resource Utilization:** Check CPU, memory, and network usage for pods and nodes using Prometheus/Grafana.
    *   **Check Database Performance:** Analyze slow queries and connection pool usage.
    *   **Ask:** **Ask the veteran performance tuning team** for specific insights into common bottlenecks. They might have "secrets" related to JVM tuning or database indexing strategies.

5.  **CI/CD Pipeline Failures:**
    *   **Check Pipeline Logs:** Review the logs of the specific build or deployment job.
    *   **Verify Credentials:** Ensure the pipeline has the correct access to the container registry and Kubernetes cluster.
    *   **Gotcha:** Sometimes, stale build artifacts can cause issues. Try clearing the build cache.

### 5. Best Practices

This section outlines recommended practices for implementing and managing the Cloud-Native Banking Services. **Note:** These practices may sometimes be contradicted by actual implementation choices due to time constraints or legacy systems.

*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to manage infrastructure provisioning.
    *   **Contradiction:** In the rush to meet the 90-day go-live, some infrastructure was provisioned manually. This should be refactored.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Treat containers as immutable. Do not SSH into running containers to make changes.
    *   **Contradiction:** During critical debugging sessions, engineers have been known to SSH into pods to inspect files. This is discouraged.
*   **Automated Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
    *   **Contradiction:** While unit tests are generally good, integration and end-to-end test coverage can be inconsistent, especially for newer microservices.
*   **Secrets Management:** Use Kubernetes Secrets or a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) for sensitive information.
    *   **Contradiction:** Some sensitive configurations might still be hardcoded in environment variables in older deployments. This is a security risk.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up robust monitoring and alerting for key performance indicators (KPIs) and error rates.
    *   **Contradiction:** Alerts are sometimes noisy or not configured for critical failure scenarios.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the deployed services and infrastructure.
    *   **Security Consideration (Afterthought):** Security scanning of container images should be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. This was an afterthought and needs to be prioritized.
*   **Performance Tuning "Secrets":**
    *   **Veteran Secret 1:** For Java-based microservices, tuning the garbage collection algorithm (e.g., G1GC) can significantly improve performance.
    *   **Veteran Secret 2:** Database connection pool sizing is critical. Over-provisioning can lead to resource exhaustion, while under-provisioning can cause request queuing.
    *   **Veteran Secret 3:** Network latency between microservices can be a bottleneck. Consider co-locating frequently communicating services within the same availability zone or even the same Kubernetes node (with careful resource management).
