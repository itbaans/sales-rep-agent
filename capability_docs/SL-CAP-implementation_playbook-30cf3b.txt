### 2. Setup Guide

This guide outlines the initial setup for new projects adopting our DevOps and Agile Engineering Practices.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Access to Studio 77 environment.
*   Git credentials.
*   Docker Hub credentials (for external dependencies, if any).

**Step 1: Project Initialization**

1.  **Create a new Git repository:**
    *   Navigate to `gitlab.systems.local`.
    *   Click "New Project".
    *   Project Name: `[YourProjectName]`
    *   Visibility Level: Private
    *   Initialize repository with a README.md.
    *   **Important:** Ensure the project name follows the `[TeamAbbreviation]-[ApplicationName]` convention (e.g., `ENG-AuthService`).

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@gitlab.systems.local:[YourNamespace]/[YourProjectName].git
    cd [YourProjectName]
    ```

**Step 2: Jenkins Pipeline Setup**

1.  **Create a `Jenkinsfile`:**
    *   Create a file named `Jenkinsfile` in the root of your repository.
    *   **Initial Template (Java Project):**
        ```groovy
        pipeline {
            agent any // This will use any available agent. Consider specific labels for better control.

            stages {
                stage('Checkout') {
                    steps {
                        checkout scm
                    }
                }
                stage('Build') {
                    steps {
                        // Example for Maven:
                        sh 'mvn clean package'
                    }
                }
                stage('Test') {
                    steps {
                        // Example for Maven:
                        sh 'mvn test'
                    }
                }
                stage('Build Docker Image') {
                    steps {
                        script {
                            // Hardcoded image name for demonstration.
                            def imageName = "docker-registry.systems.local/systems-ltd/${env.JOB_NAME}:${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
                            sh "docker build -t ${imageName} ."
                            sh "docker push ${imageName}"
                        }
                    }
                }
                stage('Deploy to Staging') {
                    steps {
                        // Placeholder for deployment script.
                        echo "Deploying to staging..."
                        // Ask John Doe about the specific deployment scripts for Staging.
                    }
                }
            }
            post {
                always {
                    // Clean up workspace
                    cleanWs()
                }
   
[CONFIGURATION: Environment-specific values not parameterized]
             success {
                    echo 'Pipeline finished successfully!'
                }
                failure {
                    echo 'Pipeline failed!'
                    // Consider adding notifications here.
                }
            }
        }
        ```

2.  **Configure Jenkins Job:**
    *   Navigate to your Jenkins instance (`jenkins.systems.local`).
    *   Click "New Item".
    *   Enter Item Name: `[YourProjectName]`
    *   Select "Pipeline" and click "OK".
    *   In the "Pipeline" section:
        *   Definition: "Pipeline script from SCM"
        *   SCM: "Git"
        *   Repository URL: `git@gitlab.systems.local:[YourNamespace]/[YourProjectName].git`
        *   Credentials: Select your GitLab credentials.
        *   Branch S
[CONFIGURATION: Environment-specific values not parameterized]
pecifier: `*/main` (or your primary branch).
        *   Script Path: `Jenkinsfile`
    *   Save the job.

**Environment-Specific Gotchas:**
*   **Studio 77 VM Agent Configuration:** Ensure your Jenkins build agents are properly configured with the necessary SDKs and tools. If you encounter issues with `mvn` or `docker` commands, check the agent's PATH environment variable. Ask Sarah Lee for the standard build agent image.
*   **NFS Mount Permissions:** If your build process requires writing to shared directories, ensure correct NFS mount permissions are set. Incorrect permissions are a common cause of build failures.
*   **Docker Daemon Access:** Jenkins build agents need access to the Docker daemon. This is typically handled by adding the `jenkins` user to the `docker` group on the build agent VM.

### 3. Configuration Reference

This section provides examples of common configurations.

**Jenkinsfile Snippets:**

*   **Conditional Stages:**
    ```groovy
    stage('Deploy to Production') {
        when {
            branch 'main' // Only run on the main branch
        }
        steps {
            echo "Deploying to Production..."
            // Ask David Chen for production deployment credentials and procedures.
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Environment Variables:**
    ```groovy
    environment {
        // Hardcoded database credentials for a sample project.
        // NEVER hardcode sensitive information in production Jenkinsfiles.
        DB_HOST = 'db.staging.systems.local'
        DB_PORT = '5432'
        DB_USER = 'staging_user'
        DB_PASSWORD = 'supersecretpassword123' // Example only! Use Jenkins Credentials.
    }
    ```

### 4. Troubleshooting

This section covers common issues encountered during implementation.

1.  **Pipeline Failures:**
    *   **Check Jenkins Console Output:** This is the first place to look for error messages.
    *   **Verify Build Agent Environment:** Ensure all necessary tools (Maven, Docker, Node.js, etc.) are installed and configured correctly on the build agent.
    *   **Permissions Issues:** Check file permissions on the build agent, especially for writing to directories or executing scripts.
    *   **Network Connectivity:** Ensure the build agent can reach external services (GitLab, Nexus, Docker Registry).
    *   **Contact Support:** If you cannot resolve the issue after checking the above, please contact the DevOps Support Team at `devops-support@systems.local`.

2.  **Docker Build Failures:**
    *   **Dockerfile Syntax Errors:** Review your `Dockerfile` for any syntax mistakes.
    *   **Missing Dependencies in Dockerfile:** Ensure all required packages and libraries are installed within the Docker image build process.
    *   **Insufficient Disk Space on Build Agent:** Docker images can consume significant disk space. Check available space on the build agent.

3.  **Deployment Issues:**
    *   **Incorrect Deployment Scripts:** Verify that your deployment scripts are correctly written and target the intended environment.
    *   **Configuration Mismatches:** Ensure environment-specific configurations (e.g., database connection strings, API endpoints) are correctly applied.
    *   **Ask Mark Johnson:** For complex deployment issues, Mark Johnson is the go-to expert.

4.  **Automated Test Failures:**
    *   **Environment Differences:** Ensure the test environment closely mirrors the production environment.
    *   **Test Data Issues:** Verify that test data is correctly set up and available.
    *   **Flaky Tests:** Some tests might be unreliable. Investigate if the test itself is the issue or a genuine application bug.

### 5. Best Practices

Adhering to these practices will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of your DevOps and Agile Engineering efforts.

*   **Embrace Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage your infrastructure (VMs, network configurations) using tools like Ansible.
*   **Automate Everything:** Strive to automate all repetitive tasks, from building and testing to deployment and monitoring.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI):** Integrate code changes frequently into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests.
*   **Continuous Delivery/
[WARNING: Deprecated approach - remove before production use]
Deployment (CD):** Automate the release of software to production or staging environments.
*   **Shift-Left Testing:** Integrate testing early and often in the development lifecycle.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Treat infrastructure components as disposable. When updates are needed, replace rather than modify.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to gain visibility into application performance and health.
*   **Security First:** Integrate security practices throughout the development lifecycle (DevSecOps). This includes static code analysis, dependency scanning, and secure credential management.
*   **Cross-Functional Teams:** Foster collaboration between development, operations, and QA to break down silos.
*   **Regular Retrospectives:** Conduct regular retrospectives to identify areas for improvement in processes and practices.

**Contradicted by Actual Implementations:**
*   While "Security First" is a best practice, many teams still struggle with integrating security scans into their CI pipelines, often treating them as an afterthought.
*   The "Immutable Infrastructure" principle is often bypassed due to the perceived complexity of managing stateful applications within the Studio 77 environment.
*   Many teams still rely on manual deployments for critical production releases, despite the availability of CD pipelines.

---

**Security Considerations:**

*   **Credential Management:** Use Jenkins Credentials Manager for storing sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and SSH keys. **Never hardcode credentials in Jenkinsfiles or configuration files.**
*   **Access Control:** Implement strict access control for GitLab, Jenkins, and other critical tools.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate tools like SonarQube for static code analysis and OWASP Dependency-Check for identifying known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   **Network Security:** Ensure Studio 77 network policies are reviewed and updated to restrict unauthorized access.

**Performance Tuning Secrets:**

*   **Jenkins Agent Optimization:** For heavily utilized build agents, consider pre-caching common dependencies (e.g., Maven artifacts, Docker layers) to reduce build times. Ask the veteran engineers on the Platform team for their specific caching strategies.
*   **Docker Layer Caching:** Structure your `Dockerfile` to leverage Docker's build cache effectively. Place frequently changing instructions (like `COPY . .`) towards the end of the `Dockerfile`.
*   **Parallel Execution:** Configure Jenkins pipelines to run stages or steps in parallel where possible to reduce overall execution time.
*   **Optimized Test Suites:** Identify and optimize slow-running tests. Consider parallelizing test execution if your framework supports it
